{"title":"Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex","body":[],"content":"North Korea's railroad system, with over 7,400 kilometers (km) of track, is critical both to the North Korean economy and national defense, serving as the primary means for the country's long-haul cargo and passenger transportation.1According to the official North Korea 2009 census, Wonsan city is North Korea's fifth-largest city by population size and is the capital of Kangwon province on North Korea's east coast. The city also serves as an important transportation hub with a relatively good highway connection to Pyongyang, an airport, a port, and the Kangwon railway line. Wonsan is best known to the world as a tourist destination. Its importance as such is highlighted by Kim Jong-un's specific mention in his 2018 New Year's address calling for completion in the shortest period of time of the Wonsan-Kalma tourist area and paying a visit to give on-the-spot guidance in the spring. This has interesting implications for the economic development of industry in the city as large industrial expansion seems unlikely.2 Even so, Wonsan is home to a handful of light and heavy industries with a dozen or so important companies, including the Wonsan Rolling Stock Complex. The city's industries include steel, shipbuilding, cement, shoes, textiles, tractors, fisheries, and others. There are also a number of universities and at least one research institute in Wonsan. Wonsan's port boasts the greatest length of dock space in the country at approximately 3,166 meters. (Though the port's cargo and coal handling capacity is significantly less than the ports in Chongjin and Nampho.)Despite being eclipsed in recent news by the tourist zone development, the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex plays an important role in the city as well as in the regional and national economies. As efforts progress to modernize and reconnect the eastern transportation corridor between North and South Korea under the April 27 Panmunjeom Declaration, a joint declaration for peace, prosperity, and unification, the railcars produced and serviced at the complex could play an increasingly important role. The Wonsan Rolling Stock Complex is one of just five major industrial facilities that undertake railcar production and depot-level repairs for the nationwide network.\n\n                                Recent imagery courtesy of Digital Globe.\n\n             Of these national facilities, the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex is the largest manufacturing and repair facility for railroad railcars (also called rolling stock) in the nation. It also undertakes repairs to diesel, electric, and steam locomotives, although it is not known to produce them. As such it represents an indispensable component of both North Korea's economy and national defense.3\n\n             Located in the southern section of the port city of Wonsan, Kangwon Province, adjacent to the Kalma Rail Station, the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex (39.140053 127.475910) manufactures and repairs railway rolling stock; repairs steam, diesel, and electric locomotives; and produces railcar and locomotive components and sub-systems. As of June 2018, commercial satellite imagery shows that the complex is active and appears well maintained by North Korean standards.Although North Korean media presents a picture of the facility working at full potential, the production capacity and actual output levels for the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex are unknown. Some dated reports indicate a possible annual production capacity of up to 200 passenger and 2,000 freight cars.4Commercial satellite imagery and domestic reporting with ground imagery indicate that the complex produces or repairs a wide range of railcars, including 40-ton flat cars, 60-, 100-, and potentially 125-ton ore cars, box\/refrigerator, two-bay hopper (covered and uncovered), log\/lumber, gondolas, passenger cars, and tank. Although none were seen in either satellite and ground imagery, the complex likely produces and repairs specialized maintenance-of-way (MoW) and industrial cars. Additionally, it repairs locomotives (diesel, electric, and steam). The complex may also engage in small-scale scrapping of railcars and locomotives, and the recovery of reusable components.5\n\n                Manufacturing operations for ore cars inside an assembly hall at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex. Two sets of two-axle railcar trucks are visible in the foreground. (Uriminjokkkiri, May 1, 2013)\n\n             In addition to its production and repair responsibilities, the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex serves as a center for railroad technical research and development. Scientists and technicians from the complex work with researchers from the Railway Science Branch of the State Academy of Sciences and publish their work in North Korean scientific and technical journals.6Attesting to the complex's importance to the nation over the years, Kim Il-song, Kim Jong-il, and senior officials have visited the factory on a number of occasions and it has been frequently mentioned in North Korean media.7 There are, however, no readily available reports of Kim Jong-un visiting the factory since he came to power. Among the senior leaders to have visited the complex in recent years was Choe Ryong Hae, vice-chairman of the State Affairs Commission, and vice-chairman of the Worker's Party of Koreas Central Committee.8\n\n             The complex encompasses an irregular-shaped, fenced-in area of approximately 540,000 m2 (133 acres) and can be broken down into three functional areas: administration, engineering, and support; manufacturing and repair; and rail yard.\n\n                Recent imagery courtesy of Digital Globe.\n\n             The administrative facilities are generally concentrated along the southwest side of the complex. The manufacturing and repair facilities occupy the center of the complexmost notably 10 large assembly, repair, and fabrication halls. These halls are connected by two rail transfer tablesthe largest being approximately 420-meters-longthat move heavy parts, subassemblies, and railcars from building to building or between bays in the same building.\n\n                Recent imagery courtesy of Digital Globe.\n\n             The engineering and support facilities (fabrication shops, forges\/foundries, sheds, greenhouse, miscellaneous structures) are located along the northwest side and south-central section of the facility. These support facilities reportedly use some computer numerically controlled (CNC) equipment and appear to manufacture almost all the components (e.g., road wheels, trucks, springs, couplers) from both semi-finished components and raw materials required for production and repair operations.9 On the north side of this section is a basin used for storing logs before they are brought into the adjacent woodworking shop. There are also several greenhouses located around the complex and what appears to be a water treatment plant in the southeast corner.\n\n                Recent imagery courtesy of Digital Globe.\n\n             The rail yard is stub-ended and is served by a compound ladder with approximately 20 tracks of various lengths and functions (e.g., shipping, receiving, holding, classification). In the center of the rail yard is an open-air storage yard. Immediately north of the complex is a separate facility that appears to be for locomotive servicing (e.g., fueling, sanding, washing, minor maintenance). It is unclear if this is formally part of the complex.\n\n                Recent imagery courtesy of Digital Globe.\n\n             Commercial satellite imagery from 2014 through 2018 shows that the total number of railcars observed at the complex has varied from a high of 88 on December 22, 2014, to a low of 59 on June 6, 2018 (these numbers include the adjacent engine servicing facility).10 This should not necessarily be taken as an indication of slowing output at the complex as each image examined for this report shows both significant differences in the numbers and types of railcars present and their positioning within the facility. Instead, this suggests a dynamic production and repair facility responding to shifting demands for rolling stock and the availability of semi-finished products and raw material. For example, among the railcars present in a December 2014 image were approximately 29 ore cars\/gondolas, 12 boxcars, and 28 passenger cars. In a June 2018 image there were approximately 17 ore cars\/gondolas, 22 boxcars, and 9 passenger cars. As railcar production and repair are heavily dependent upon steel, and to a lesser degree upon iron and aluminum, fluctuations in the supply of these materials undoubtedly affect the output at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex.None of the North Korean media ground imagery reviewed for this report shows either modern manufacturing equipment or techniques employed at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex. Therefore, the production output is likely significantly lower in quantity and quality to similar-sized facilities in Asia or the West. Additionally, this ground imagery shows a facility that is in need of significant infrastructure maintenance and numerous unaddressed safety issues. Should foreign financial investment be directed to the complex in the future, a substantial amount will likely be absorbed in addressing these issues before any meaningful profit be realized.\n\n                Manufacturing operations for a covered hopper (left), ore cars (center) and box car (center rear) inside an assembly hall at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex. (Rodong Sinmun, May 10, 2015)\n\n             Obvious in summer or fall imagery of the complex is that a significant portion of all open spaces is being used for gardening. Such gardening is typical of large industrial facilities in North Korea; however, unlike the Chongjin Railway Factory, the tracks at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex are generally well maintained, ballasted, and relatively clear of gardening activity, indicating active use.References1.

These numbers should be viewed as approximations as they only count the railcars present within the complex and engine servicing facility, not the adjacent Kalma Rail Station and holding yard. Additionally, the numbers do not account for the limited number of satellite images reviewed or seasonality. A more comprehensive study would likely provide a more nuanced understanding and reveal an explanation for the apparent decline. References  \n\n If, going forward, the April 27 inter-Korea agreement is substantially executed and rapprochement leads to new opportunities for infrastructure development assistance to North Korea, activity around Wonsan is likely to provide an early and leading indicator of change given its role both in the eastern transportation corridor and the national economy. Furthermore, evidence of high-level visits to the site would be a significant sign of heightened priority being given by North Korean leadership to transportation infrastructure development and improvements.\n\n Activity around Wonsan is likely to be a leading indication of inter-Korean joint declaration progress given its role both in the eastern transportation corridor and the national economy.\n\n Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex is the largest manufacturing and repair facility for railcars in the nation. Analysis of this facility can be a brick-and-mortar signpost of foundational infrastructure progress if rapprochement leads to new opportunities for infrastructure development.\n\n Railroads and railway facilities serve as the vital link underpinning North Korea s underdeveloped economy. Together they present both new possibilities for inter-Korean relations and regional economic cooperation and foundational infrastructure for future unification. However, knowledge of North Korea s infrastructure is lacking, according to a pilot survey of regional experts conducted by CSIS Beyond Parallel. This study of North Korea s Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex builds upon our previous report of the Chongjin Railway Factory and together these reports begin to address that void.\n\nCommercial satellite imagery shows that the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex is currently active and appears to be well maintained by North Korean standards. In addition to its production and repair responsibilities, the complex serves as a center for North Korean railroad technical research and development.\n\n Background \n\n Subordinate to North Korea s Ministry of Railways are five major industrial facilities involved in the production and depot-level repair of rail cars and locomotives. These facilities are the 6 July Railway Factory, Chongjin Railway Factory, Kim Chong-tae Electric Locomotive Works, Pyongyang Rolling Stock Repair Plant, and Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex. Reflecting a general geographic division of the nation into east and west coasts caused by north-south mountain ranges, two of these the Kim Chong-tae Electric Locomotive Works and Pyongyang Rolling Stock Repair Plant are located on the west coast in Pyongyang, and three are located on the east coast 6 July Railway Factory, Chongjin Railway Factory,  and Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex. \n\nThe Ministry of Railways also exercises control over the rail network including research and development, education and training, security, railroad operations, acquisition, and production. The Korean State Railway conducts rail operations through at least six regional bureaus Chongjin, Hamhung, Kaechon, Pyongyang, Naseon, and Sariwon.  Subordinate to these regional rail bureaus are more than 20 secondary repair shops and 50 engine houses located along the rail network throughout the nation that undertake minor repairs and routine maintenance. The Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex is believed to be directly subordinate to the Ministry of Railways; however, its location in Wonsan means that it works closely with the Wonsan Railway Bureau.\n\nPrevious names for the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex have included the KaIma Railroad Plant, Wonsan Railroad Factory, and 4 June Rolling Stock Works (sometimes referred to in English as the 4 June Rolling-Stock Works, June 4 General Rolling-Stock Works, or Wonsan Railroad Car Manufacturing and Rolling Stock Repair Plant). Today the complex is sometimes referred to in English as the Wonsan Railroad Car Manufacturing and Rolling Stock Repair Plant or Wo'san Railway Rolling Stock Complex.\n\n Renewed Success \n\n During early 2007, North Korean media reported that production  was put on a normal basis at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Factory,  suggesting that the facility had finally recovered from the effects of the Arduous March.  Supporting this assessment, a senior Ministry of Railways official noted, during 2009, that  the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex is increasing the production of goods wagons with emphasis placed on producing stout wagons short in length and with high side walls compared with the previous models.   Since that time, the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex has continued to be mentioned within the context of achieving success in the production and repair of rail cars including the production of a  100-ton wagon  (presumed to be an ore car) in 2016. \n\n Becoming the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex \n\n By 2005, concerted efforts of previous years appear to have finally made progress in restoring meaningful production as the North Korean magazine Ch o llima claims that the complex produced 200 to 300 new trains and freight cars that year undoubtedly an inflated number. \n\nPossibly as a reflection of the improving output from the 4 June Rolling Stock Factory, sometime between 2005-2006 the facility was renamed the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex.\n\n Efforts to Restore Production \n\n During 2000, as a reflection of North Korea s industries struggling to overcome the effects of the Arduous March,  15 April Technical Innovation Shock Brigade  campaigns were conducted at numerous large complexes including the 4 June Rolling Stock Complex. These campaigns reportedly resulted in  many raw materials, fuel, and enormous efforts and materials including tens of billions of kilowatts of electricity, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of coal, thousands of tonnes of steel materials, thousands of tonnes of fuel, and some one thousand nonferrous metals were saved.  \n\nThroughout the following four years, numerous reports in North Korean media suggested that significant efforts were being undertaken to restore production and output at the 4 June Rolling Stock Complex and throughout the rail sector. On October 21, 2002, Kim Chong-il gave on-the-spot guidance at the complex reinforcing the importance of its work and encouraging the workers to greater productivity.  Other resources were mobilized and during 2002 2003 to support recovery, Yang Yong-nok, a deputy director within the Ministry of Labor, and other members of the ministry were assigned to the 4 June Rolling Stock Plant to assist with labor administration and propaganda. More significantly, they arranged for on-the-job training for workers.  Admitting to the continuing challenges faced within the rail sector, and that Kim Chong-il was concerned about them, Rodong Sinmun published an article in April 2003 that stated,  In recent years, the great general has energetically led the work for development of the railway transport, although everything was in short supply and everything was difficult.   \n\n Economic collapse\n\n During the 1990s, however, like almost all North Korean industries the 4 June Rolling Stock Complex suffered a severe decline in production output as a result of the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union that resulted in the subsequent financial collapse of North Korea. Following the financial collapse was a prolonged period of dramatic droughts and floods that devastated crop yields, resulting in nationwide famine that also witnessed the death of Kim Il-sung. Collectively, this period is known as the Arduous March and while it is generally agreed to have ended during 1998, the effects lasted into the 2000s. The 4 June Rolling Stock Complex appears to have received little mention in North Korean media during this period although a 1997 report states that Kim Chong-il sent his thanks to the complex for their success in repairing freight cars. \n\n Facility Expansion and Growing Production, late 1970s - 1990 \n\n During the 1970s, however, a major expansion took place of the east side of the facility with the addition of an assembly hall, fabrication hall, foundry building, and support facilities as seen in a September 1980 declassified satellite image. This expansion may have resulted from the December 1977 Supreme People s Assembly when Kim Il-song established strategic direction and guidelines for railway development and railcar production.  Although it is presently unclear, this expansion may have also resulted in the renaming of the Wonsan Railroad Factory to the 4 June Rolling Stock Works.\n\nProduction at the complex likely grew during the late-1970s and through the 1980s. Reflecting the relatively good times of the 1980s, and a very inflated dose of propaganda, the official guide to Kangwon Province, published in 1990, claimed that the complex could produce 5,000 freight cars annually.  \n\n Reconstruction, 1950s - 1960s\n\n Following the Korean War, one of the first areas for reconstruction was the rail network throughout the nation including, once again, the Wonsan Railroad Factory, which was rebuilt with Polish assistance. The facility first became operational in 1957 and construction was completed during the mid-1960s. \n\nThe composition of the Wonsan Railroad Factory underwent several minor infrastructure changes during the 1960s and early 1970s as indicated by declassified KH-4A image and reports.  For example, between November 1967 and October 1969, the facility was extended on the north side to accommodate construction of a holding yard. \n\n Wonsan s First Railroad Activity Through the War Years, early 1940s - early 1950 \n\n As with the Chongjin Railway Factory, the first significant railroad activity in the Wonsan area occurred during the colonial period as part of the Japanese development of military facilities (naval base, airfield, etc.) and a broader economic effort to construct a rail network throughout Korea to support mining and industrial development. Track was laid from Wonsan (called Genzan at the time by the Japanese) north along the coast through Chongjin (called Seishin at the time by the Japanese) to Hoeryong in the north. Within Wonsan a range of railroad facilities were constructed to support this rail line and service the port facilities. Among these facilities was the KaIma Railroad Plant built by the Japanese in the early 1940s immediately south of the city.  \n\nThe KaIma Railroad Plant was reportedly destroyed during World War II when Soviet troops occupied the city. During the immediate post World War II period, the nascent North Korean government took control of the rail network within the northern half of the peninsula and began its reconstruction with Soviet assistance. This included the KaIma Railroad Plant, which was renamed the Wonsan Railroad Factory. Underscoring the importance of the facility to the nation at this time, Kim Il-song visited the Wonsan Railroad Factory in 1947 and provided what has subsequently become known as  on-the-spot guidance.  \n\nDuring the Korean War, Wonsan, including the Wonsan Railroad Factory, was heavily damaged by United Nations Command air strikes. With the signing of the Armistice Agreement in 1953, North Korea undertook reconstruction efforts with assistance from China, the Soviet Union, and other communist countries.","authors":["Joseph Bermudez","Marie DuMond","Victor Cha"],"categories":["North Korea's Economy"],"tags":["csis","economy","rail","wonsan"],"url":"http:\/\/www.tearline.mil\/public_page\/wonsan-railway-rolling-stock-complex\/","id":null}
{"title":"The Ice Curtain: Russia's Military Moves Further North","body":null,"content":"IntroductionIn April 2017, Russia unveiled an Arctic Trefoil military base on Alexandra Land Island in the northeast Barents Sea. It is Russia's northern-most military outpost, and the second of its kind following the completed Northern Clover on Kotelny. Alexandra Land is also home to the upgraded Nagurskoye Airbase. Rather than ensuring these new Arctic bases remain secret, the Russian government is encouraging virtual tours of its state-of-the-art, three unit clover-like compound which is designed to withstand severe weather. Russia's military posture on Alexandra Land provides air, sea, and land capabilities which reinforce Russia's multi-layered maritime and air denial capabilities; safeguard the Kola Peninsula which is home to Northern Fleet headquarters and Russia's advanced Arctic land, air, and naval assets including its nuclear arsenal and second-strike capabilities; and ensure Russia's access to and control over the Northern Sea Route. Geographically, Alexandra Lands proximity to the Greenland-Iceland-Norway (GIN) and Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) gaps and its increased capabilities could disrupt NATO's vital sea lines of communication (SLOC) between North America and Europe, hindering U.S. military reinforcement to Europe.BackgroundAlexandra Land Island (Ostrov Zemlya Aleksandry) is the largest island in Russia's Franz Josef Land Archipelago (Zemlya Frantsa-Iosifa), and its strategic importance to Russia's national defense and presence in the Arctic dates back to the early 1950s.1 During the Cold War the former Soviet Union established and maintained the Nagurskoye Airbase, which included the 31st Separate Radar Company, a meteorological station, a small dirt\/snow airfield (known as the Nagurskoye Snow Strip), and likely small signal and communication intelligence collection units. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, these facilities were substantially reduced to a FSB [Federal Security Service] border post (30 persons), Arctic specialists (16 persons) and meteorologists (six persons) who lived and work there.2An important shift in Russia's military doctrine in 2008, which elevated the strategic importance of the Arctic, revived Alexandra Land's importance to the Kremlin. The reconstitution of the Nagurskoye airbase and construction of new facilities better secures northern approaches to Russia's coastline, protects its vast mineral and energy resources, and improves monitoring of maritime shipping activity across the Northern Sea Route. President Putin personally visited Franz Josef Land in April 2010 following a maritime border demarcation agreement in the Barents Sea between Russia and Norway, paving the way for oil and gas exploration along the maritime border.Five years later in 2013, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that would reestablish a regular naval and military presence in the Arctic.3 As part of its plan, the meteorological station on Alexandra Land would be supplemented by the addition of permanent military facilities that would include a new airbase, housing and administration trefoil, air traffic control and air defense units and radars, and other support installations.4\n\n             Alexandra Land Island (June 31, 2013)\n\n             Alexandra Land Island (July 22, 2016)\n\n             Alexandra Land Island (March 19, 2019)Construction moved quickly, and in November 2014 units of the Northern Fleet's air defense division deployed to Alexandra Land and were housed in a temporary camp.5 The following month construction of the housing and administration trefoil began. In October 2015 Northern Fleet Commander Admiral Vladimir Korolev stated that construction of the trefoil was 60 percent completed.6 By the fall of 2016, the trefoil compound was completed.7\n\n             Housing and Administration Trefoil Area (June 30, 2013)\n\n             Housing and Administration Trefoil Area (July 22, 2016)\n\n             Housing and Administration Trefoil Area (March 19, 2019)In April 2015 it was announced that a new 2,500-meters-long temporary seasonal airfield covered with ice would be constructed on Alexandra Land to accept delivery of personnel and cargo.8 The following year, it was announced that this new airfield would be extended to a Class 2 year-round runway [and would] have dimensions of 2.5-kilometers-by-42-meters and be completed by the end of 2016.9 That same month Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that a group of either Su-34 multirole fighter aircraft or MiG-31 fighters would be based at the new Nagurskoye Airbase, alongside Il-78 tankers.10 When completed, the airbase and air units would consist of heated hangars for Su-34 or MiG-31 aircraft, an aviation headquarters, a separate radar company, air traffic control facility, antiaircraft artillery battalion, and communications and support sub-units. Nagurskoye Airbase would be capable of receiving and basing of all type of aircraft, including strategic bombers, and defending itself.11\n\n             Nagurskoye Airfield (July 22, 2016)\n\n             Nagurskoye Airfield (March 19, 2019)With the upgrade to Nagurskoye Airbase, Russia has established a new air defense division in the Arctic which includes the units on Franz Josef Land (to include Alexandra Land Island), and units on Novaya Zemlya, Severnaya Zemlya, the New Siberian Islands, Cape Schmidt, Wrangle Island and Tiksi, covering an area of approximately 4,800 km.12AnalysisLocation, Location, LocationAlexandra Land's location advances two Russian objectives in the Arctic: (1) it enhances Russian territorial defense and (2) improves monitoring and control over maritime activity across the Northern Sea Route. As its northern most military installation, Alexandra Land pushes Russia's military and forward line of defense further north into the Arctic Ocean, making it a key outpost to observe NATO activity and capabilities. Considering that the four other Arctic coastal states are NATO members, Alexandra Land effectively represents a marker, stymieing what Russia may interpret as NATO expansion in the region. The Sopka-2 radar system improves Russian air and maritime domain awareness in the Arctic and supplements Russia's strategic early warning radar network to detect U.S. or NATO aircraft and missiles when flying over the top.\n\n             Sopka-2 Radar and Communications Installations (June 30, 2013)\n\n             Sopka-2 Radar and Communications Installations (July 22, 2016)\n\n             Sopka-2 Radar and Communications Installations (March 19, 2019)Similar to the Sopka-2 radar installation on Wrangel Island, Alexandra Land is part of a larger network covering Russia's northern border in the form of a protective dome against foreign aircraft, missiles, and ships.Alexandra Land is also situated along the Northern Sea Route. In anticipation of increased maritime activity, the Russian government increasingly seeks to enhance its surveillance, enforcement, and defensive capabilities along the route. There are also growing concerns about potential military activity. In March, the Russian government imposed limits on foreign warships transiting the NSR, requiring 45 days notice for voyages. This new limitation runs counter to international maritime law as the majority of the international community views the NSR as an international passage meaning freedom of navigation should be permitted, although it is rarely tested in the Arctic. This is a concerning development that could hinder the conduct of innocent passage through the NSR.Defending Against \"Over the Top\" ThreatsAlexandra Land plays a critical role in protecting the Kola Peninsula, home to the Northern Fleet headquarters at Severomorsk. The Kola Peninsula is a vital center of Russia's military power because of its modernized nuclear submarine fleet and nuclear missiles and conventional long-range high-precisions cruise missiles. Multiple layers of defense consisting of maritime and land capabilities serves two crucial functions: denying access to foreign naval forces and ensuring the survivability and second-strike capability of strategic ballistic missile submarines.13 The Kola Peninsula is increasingly fortified by Arctic outposts like Alexandra Land which develops military supremacy out to the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) gap while strengthening Russia's bastion defense capabilities.Displaying its growing military strength in the Arctic, in June, Russias Northern Fleet tested the Tor-M2DT missile system, with a missile range of 15 kilometers. According to reports, the Tor-M2DT is likely to be deployed to several remote military installations, including Franz Josef Land. Tests of the new system follow reports of past deployments of notable air defense assets including the S-300 (NATO: SA-10 Grumble) air defense system and the Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft system. Complimented by the rumored presence of K-300P Bastion-P (NATO SSC-5) coastal defense systems armed with P-800 Oniks anti-ship cruise missiles (NATO: SS-N-26 strobile) and 4K51 Rubezh (NATO: SSC-3 Styx) anti-ship system, Alexandra Land would be a center point of a developing A2\/AD bubble extending into international waters of the Central Arctic Ocean and Barents Sea. However, none of the satellite images analyzed capture such equipment.But We Can Speculate About Power Projection ScenariosWhile Alexandra Land's primary function is to enhance Russian air and coastal defense, the growing military capabilities on Nagurskoye Airbase suggest that Alexandra land could be a staging location for future offensive and power projection capabilities. Following the upgrades in 2016 to a Class 2 year-round runway, Nagurskoye Airbase is now capable of hosting fighter and refueling aircraft, notably Su-34 and MiG-31 fighter jets and Il-78 refueling tankers. Based on a 2018 Danish Intelligence Risk Assessment, Russian aircraft based at Nagurskoye Airbase are capable of reaching the airspace over north-eastern Greenland with little prior warning. Supported by air-to-air refueling, Russian combat aircraft could reach Thule Air Base, a key installation in the U.S. space and missile defense architecture while also enlarging Russia's A2\/AD bubble into the North Atlantic.\n\n             Estimated combat aircraft range from Nagurskoye Airbase without and with air-to-air refueling. Source: Danish Defense Intelligence Service; CSISThe size and scale of recent Russian exercises in the Barents and Norwegian Seas suggest that it seeks to practice and test its expanding defense capabilities in the North Atlantic. In August, the Northern Fleet completed a comprehensive naval aviation exercise involving more than 50 aircraft, including fighter jets, bombers, Tu-142 anti-submarine planes, Il-38, MiG-31, Su-33 and Su-24 fighter jets in addition to nearly 2,000 ground personnel. The maritime component of the drill included 30 Russian naval vessels including surface ships, submarines, and supply ships. Norwegian Chief of Defense Haakon Bruun-Hansen suggested these are exercises designed to block NATO's access to the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Norwegian Sea, hindering NATO reinforcements to Norway. Importantly, Russian forces for this exercise emanated from Russia's Northern, Baltic, and Black Sea fleets, suggesting that NATO should reconceptualize its understanding of how Russia will defend the Arctic and what resources NATO would draw upon to defend its allies.ConclusionAlexandra Land and Nagurskoye Airbase increase Russia's air and maritime defense capabilities in the Arctic. The most concerning aspect, however, is Alexandra Land's potential as a staging ground for power projection into the Central Arctic and North Atlantic. The Trefoil compound and its support facilities raise the level of readiness of Russia's Arctic forces potentially to the point where Norway's freedom of action and movement is restricted and potential Allied access to the North Atlantic is cut off. Sending NATO reinforcements to defend Norway would prove challenging, and NATO's freedom of navigation in the Arctic could be reduced. At the moment, however, the satellite imagery does not indicate such an expansion is occurring or capabilities are present.The ongoing Russian military exercise, Tsentr-2019, should provide greater insight into new Russian Arctic capabilities as well as Alexandra Land's role in Russia's bastion defense. There are reports of significant quantities of deliveries to Franz Josef Land prior to Tsentr. The U.S. and NATO must closely monitor and analyze the Tsentr exercise to examine shifts in and changes to Russia's Arctic military posture.References and NotesAirfields on Ice?, Air Intelligence Digest, June 1951, pp. 9-14 [Declassified]; and Soviet Arctic Airfields, Air Intelligence Digest, May 1952, pp. 8-10 [Declassified]The 31st Separate Radar Company, along with the 30th Separate Radar Company on Graham Bell Island, which were reportedly the two northernmost military bases of the Soviet Armed Forces, were disbanded in the early 1990s.

{"title":"The Ice Curtain: Enhanced Defense of Russia's Western Arctic","body":null,"content":"BackgroundRogachevo Air Base is located approximately 9 kilometers north-northeast of Belushya Guba (Belushya Bay) on the southern Yuzhny Island of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago. This air base routinely hosted long-range strategic bombers and fighter aircraft to intercept U.S. reconnaissance aircraft in the Arctic during the Cold War.1 Today, Rogachevo is commanded by the 45th Air Force and Air Defense Army of the Russian Northern Fleet which was formed in December 2015.2\n\n   Source: Google EarthSatellite imagery indicates that sometime between July 2014 and August 2015 a new air defense missile base was established west of the Rogachevo air base accompanied by a regiment-sized unit equipped with the S-300P (NATO reporting name: SA-10 Grumble) surface-to-air missile (SAM).3 Upgrades to air defense capabilities on Novaya Zemlya occurred during 2018-2019 and included the deployment of additional radar, electronic warfare, signals intelligence forces and related equipment in addition to the deployment of the S-400 (an upgrade from the S-300P) with the latter occurring during the July-August 2019 time frame.On September 16th the Russian Northern Fleet Press Service reported that the redeployment of forces and conversion to the S-400 system was complete.4 A few days later, on September 20th, the Press Service published a report on the ceremony celebrating the unit's achievement of operational status.5AnalysisThe Importance of S-400s in the ArcticRussia's military posture in its Western Arctic reflects the Soviet legacy of bastion defense comprised of concentric circles designed to protect strategic territory.6 The S-400s provide more advanced radar and electronic warfare systems capabilities which expand the range of Novaya Zemlya's air defenses. The airspace monitored and controlled from Rogachevo Air Base has now increased to 600 kilometers for detection and 400 kilometers for engagement, according to Russian assessments,7 although western analysts estimate the range to be between 200-250km based on the system's current configuration.The S-400 reportedly reduces deployment time from stowed position to launch to 5 minutes8and complements previously implemented enhanced defensive measures including the establishment of two Arctic motorized brigades, an Arctic naval group and a command and control center at the refurbished Severomorsk-1 airbase.Russia's priority in the Arctic is to defend its northwest coast and the surrounding maritime domain around the Northern Fleet, Russia's most capable naval force which includes its only operational aircraft carrier, ballistic missile submarines, and surface combatants and submarines that are deployed worldwide. Russia's efforts to modernize its Arctic military posture includes refurbishing air bases and deploying advanced systems to defend and deny access to strategic bastions. The deployment of S-400 systems to Rogachevo Air Base enhances radar coverage around the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, plugging potential gaps between Nagurskoye Air Base on Alexandra Land and radar stations on the Kola Peninsula.As Russia seeks to increase the Northern Sea Route's economic viability, Russia perceives greater strategic vulnerability in its Far North.9 The S-400s and similar air defense systems deployed across the Russian Arctic (Alexandra Land, Kotelny, and Wrangel Island among others) address this vulnerability as the growing network of assets seeks to restrict freedom of action and lay the groundwork for effective anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) operations.The S-400s however pose a challenge to NATO in the region, potentially complicating aircraft freedom of operation in the Norwegian and Barents Seas, and potentially out to the North Atlantic. The system reinforces Russia's bastion defense and expands Russia's defensive capabilities potentially beyond the Barents Sea, while also complicating future efforts to reinforce regional allies during a time of crisis. On an operational level, the S-400 raises the potential costs for allies in the event of conflict, deterring them from deploying assets to the region.Russian Exercising of Its Bastion DefenseRussia continues to demonstrate that its growing military capabilities in the Arctic can be deployed beyond the Kola Peninsula. In April, Russia issued a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) for the Norwegian Sea area along Norway's northern coast where Russian strike forces, including anti-submarine Tu-142s, long-range supersonic missile carrier-bombers Tu-22M3 aircraft, along with cruisers and submarines exercised bastion defense. It was reportedly the first time Russia has conducted such a complex exercise outside of the Kola Peninsula and Barents Sea, suggesting that Russia may be looking to expand its offensive operations and sea denial capabilities toward the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) Gap. Although incomplete, Russia's layering of air defense systems enhances deterrence against, and costs to the U.S. and NATO in the Arctic.DescriptionSatellite imagery of the Rogachevo Air Base S-400 air defense missile base is located at 71.606747o N, 52.387603o E, approximately 3.2 kilometers west of the air base. It occupies an irregular shaped area that measures 700-meters-by-180-meters, encompasses approximately 104,600 square meters and is organized into a regiment-sized unit with:A headquarters and support area that appears to include the regimental headquarters, target acquisition battery, missile technical battery, transport company and maintenance company. Among the equipment visible are a number of 55K6E command post vehicles, a 91N6E Big Bird acquisition and battle management radar, a LEMZ 96L6-1\/96L6E acquisition radar, two 5P85SM\/SE2 self-propelled transporter erector-launchers (likely as spares or for training) and a number of support vehicles and trailers.Three firing battery areas.

{"title":"Mining North Korea: Magnesite Production at Ryongyang Mine","body":null,"content":"North Korea is a nation with immense non-ferrous and rare-earth mineral reserves. Among these is magnesite, which has been mined in commercially viable quantities since the Japanese colonial period. The United States Geological Survey estimates North Korea has 2.3 billion metric tons of magnesite reserves and that its total 2018 mine production of magnesite was 270,000 metric tons. While this is a decline from 380,000 metric tons during 2017 due to international sanctions imposed during 2017, magnesite remains both an important export and domestic commodity for North Korea. Since 2010, North Korea has exported magnesia to a number of countries including, but not limited to China, the Netherlands, and Germany. Of these, China is, by a large margin, North Korea's largest customer for magnesite. The Korean International Trade Association estimates North Korea exports 130-180 thousand tons of magnesite to China each year. Foreign analysts, especially in South Korea, believe China's large long-term purchases of North Korean rare-earth and non-ferrous minerals, including magnesite, are a component of a strategy to lock out competitors and influence world market pricing.1The mining and export of magnesite, and the domestic production of products from it, are important to the North Korean government and economy as indicated by the praise the Ryongyang Mine and other magnesite mines and production facilities have routinely received from Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un. For example, in remarks at an October 2011 field guidance, Kim Jong-il reiterated great satisfaction over the laudable feats performed by the workers of the above-said industrial establishments and the Taehung and Ryongyang mines in their endeavors to make a breakthrough toward the fulfillment of their national economic plans.\n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                Ore types (Foreign Trade, 2018.01)\n             Magnesite Reserves, Production, and ExportsEstimates of North Korea's magnesite reserves and production output have fluctuated considerably over the last 20 years.2 The wide range of estimates is due to a combination of the limitations of available reliable data, methodology used in calculations, and the political agendas of the reporting sources.3 Two of the more readily accessible and reliable sources concerning North Korea's magnesite reserves and production output are the US Geological Surveys (USGS) annual Mineral Commodity Summaries and Minerals Yearbook. The Magnesium Compounds entry in the Mineral Commodity Summaries 2019 reports North Korea has 2.3 billion metric tons of magnesite reserves, tying it with Russia for the world's largest magnesite reserves. The Mineral Commodity Summaries 2019 also reports North Korea's 2018 mine production of magnesite was 270,000 metric tons, placing it tenth in the world. This figure was down from 380,000 metric tons during 2017. The year-on-year decline in magnesite production from 2017 to 2018 can largely be attributed to a decrease in magnesia exports from North Korea to China and other countries driven by restrictions from international sanctions in 2017. While exports to China resumed in 2018, North Korea's exports to other countries did not.4North Korea's magnesite reserves are primarily distributed in Hambuk and Hamnam provinces in the northeastern part of the country. With 90 percent located in the Tanchon area of Hamnam province. The remaining 10 percent are located in the Paegam-gun area of Ryanggang province and scattered around the nation.5 Among the magnesia related facilities within these two provinces are the Namgye Mine, Ryongyang Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory, Ryongyang Mine, Saengjang Mine, Songjin Refractory Factory, Ssangyong Mine, Taehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory, Taehung Mine, and Tanchon Magnesia Clinker Factory.6Magnesite in its various forms is used in a wide range of industrial, civilian and military applications. For example, \"...light magnesia is used as raw materials for livestock feed, fertilizer, wastewater treatment, exhaust gas adsorbent, building materials, glass fiber, special glass, glassware coating agent, absorbent and catalyst for uranium oxide recovery and antacid. Small magnesia is used as refractory brick to block heat transfer since it is the most heat resistant ceramic oxide. Refractories inside the blast furnace are also made of small magnesia. Molten magnesia is used for special refractory bricks and electric insulators of heating devices. 99% or more high-purity magnesia is used in optical equipment, nuclear reactors, [and] rocket nozzles.\"7Ryongyang MineRyongyang Mine (40.901815 128.804703), also known as kmlMine Facility Annotations\" class=\"green-link data-source-link\" href=\"https:\/\/public-colab-content.s3.amazonaws.com\/Ry%C5%8Fngyang+Mine+(Yongyang+Mine).kmz\" target=\"_blank\">Yongyang Mine, is located in Tanchon-gun (Tanchon County), Hamnam (South Hamgyong province) approximately 330 kilometers north-northeast of Pyongyang.8 Located on the slopes of Paekkumsan, the mine is the largest magnesite mine in North Korea and one of the largest in the world.9\n\n               Overview of the Ryongyang Mine complex including Kumgol, April 29, 2018. (Copyright 2019 by Maxar Technologies)\n             Surface mining of magnesite in the Ryongyang area began during 1942 and following World War II these activities were taken over in 1948 by the government of the newly established Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). In 1954, the magnesite mines and processing facilities in Tanchon-gun were reportedly organized under the Korea Magnesia Clinker Industry Group based in Pyongyang.10 Kim Il-sung visited the Ryongyang Mine in April 1961 and named the mountain on whose magnesite-rich slopes it was built, Paekkumsan (i.e., magnesite mountain). Kim and others would subsequently refer to the mountain as \"gold mountain\" indicating the value of the mountain to the regime.Today the Ryongyang Mine is a component of the considerably larger General Bureau of the Tanchon Area Mining Industry (sometimes referred to as the Tanchon Area General Mining Bureau) that oversees mining in Tanchon-gun. This bureau is subordinate to the Ministry of Mining Industry. Magnesite mining operations under the bureau extend north from the port city of Tanchon distributed along the valleys of the Namdae-chon (i.e., Namdae stream) and Puktae-chon (i.e., Puktae stream).Ryongyang Mine, rather than being a single mine, is more accurately a mining complex consisting of numerous mining, processing, support and housing activities that extend approximately 15 kilometers along the Puktae-chon valley and its branches. The Puktae-chon valley is served by the Kumgol rail line that passes through 24 railroad tunnels before reaching the Kumgol rail station and classification yard.Ryongyang Mine is mentioned numerous times in both North Korean and South Korean reports and described as consisting of collection of large-scale open-pit excavation, underground mines, Ryongyang Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory and a number of industrial support facilities (e.g., railroad stations, electrical substation, etc.).11 Additionally, there are housing, agricultural, social and other facilities (e.g., hospital, Ministry of People's Security, etc.) that support the workers from the mine and political and social entities. Although the precise details concerning the mines organization and the specific locations of its various activities and facilities are lacking, the following are among the most often reported:12- April 5th shaft- Chongnyong pit- Crushing, selecting, dressing and treating processes- Engineering section- General control room (reportedly at the Kumsan Pit)- July 1st shaft- June 5th pit- Kumsan pit- Kumsan pit number 2 (honored with the title of Twice Three Revolution Red Flag)- Long-distance conveyor belt system- Nomber 4 pit, Tonsan Branch- Power substation- Railroad stations and terminals, including ore loading facilities- Ryongyang Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory (produces light burned magnesia)- Ryongyang Industrial Engineering University (presumably a mining school)13- Tonsan shaftAdditionally, what has been identified as the kmlMine Facility Annotations\" class=\"green-link data-source-link\" href=\"https:\/\/public-colab-content.s3.amazonaws.com\/Ry%C5%8Fngyang+Mine+(Yongyang+Mine).kmz\" target=\"_blank\">Komdok (Kumgol) No. 3 Mine is located southeast of Kumgol-tong 2 (more commonly known as Kumgol or Komdok).

This scarring stretches north of the village of Yongyang-ni, and west of the Puktae-chon, for approximately 2.5 kilometers. All of these surface mining areas appear to have been abandoned or are largely inactive since the flooding in 2012. A long-distant conveyor belt system, leading to a mine shaft northeast of the main mines processing facility, was razed sometime during 2011-2012. Immediately west of the processing facilities are two portals leading to an underground mine. Despite numerous North Korean propaganda photographs showing extensive surface mining operations with large numbers of shovels and large mine dump trucks hauling ore, satellite imagery from the past five years provides no evidence to support this. Combined with the general lack of activity at the portals and processing facilities, and the minimal rail movements observed along the rail spur line feeding the mine, it is likely that this facility is operating a low level or intermittently.\n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                Overview of the main Ryongyang Mine, April 29, 2018.

One of the branch lines of this mine rail system runs through the mountain into the Kumgol-tong 1 valley where it terminates in a tailings pile. Two long-distance conveyor belt systems extend from the rail systems terminal to the east, across the Puktae-chon, to the Ryongyang Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory.

It also pushes the second- and third-stage processing.\" Reports also indicate that in association with the Ryongyang Mine and Taehung Youth Hero Mine that the Tanchon Magnesia Factory produces, or supplies products to produce \"chipboard and wainscot on an industrial basis. They continue to develop a variety of fine fixtures and building materials including door, newel, flowerpot, desk, shuttering and prop by raising the quality of slightly burned magnesia chipboard. Among the processed products is the roller for conveyer belt which is made of by-products from the magnesia clinker production process.\"Other items produced with products from the Tanchon Magnesia Factory reportedly include \"magnesia cement, light burned magnesia fertilizer, pulp and paper, medicines, and cosmetics.\" It is also used in the steel industry, and it can be used for optical equipment, rocket nozzles, and reactors.Aside from being used domestically the magnesite ore and products produced by the Ryongyang Mine are shipped by sea through the port of Tanchon in bulk carriers to foreign customers. The port was upgraded during 2012 to boost exports of magnesite, zinc and other mineral resources. This itself was reportedly to enable the port city of Tanchon [to] become the source of finance for the country's broader policy line of pursuing both economic development and nuclear capacities.17References1.

{"title":"North Korea\u2019s Hydroelectric Power \u2013 Part II","body":null,"content":"In an attempt to address the country's electrical energy needs, the DPRK is placing greater emphasis on the construction and utilization of both hydroelectric and coal-powered, thermal-electric power plants. To date, most of that observed growth has been in the building of hydroelectric dams, principally in the northern provinces, where the terrain is more suitable for such projects.BackgroundNorth Korea has adopted a two-pronged approach to hydroelectric generation, splitting its efforts between the construction of large-scale, hydroelectric dams designed to light and power major urban areas, and small-to-medium-sized power stations, initially intended to support local needs, but which are now being called upon to support the greater national power grid. This trend was described in Part I of this series on North Korea's hydroelectric power, which focused on the Chongchon River and the kmlHydroelectric Power Station Annotations Part 1\" class=\"green-link data-source-link\" href=\"https:\/\/public-colab-content.s3.amazonaws.com\/Hydroelectric+Report.kmz\" target=\"_blank\">12 Huichon power stations located along its length. Part II of this series takes a broader look at the kml Hydroelectric Power Station Annotations Part 2\" class=\"green-link data-source-link\" href=\"https:\/\/public-colab-content.s3.amazonaws.com\/Hydroelectric+Report+2.kmz\" target=\"_blank\">northwest quadrant of the country, which includes the provinces of Chagang and North Pyongan, and focuses on the hydroelectric dams of the Jangja (Changja) and Taeryong Rivers.DisclaimerThe period of 2009-2010 serves as the primary historical imagery baseline for the study, as earlier coverage was not within the archives available. Specific construction periods for many of the dams discussed predates this baseline, and thus the trends discussed in this report are principally those observed on imagery covering the past decade. Further, discussions regarding certain facilities being tied into North Korea's national power grid is based on a DPRK chart, translated into English, where specific plant locations are annotated on the grid. The chart also distinguishes between active and planned power plants, last updated in 2012.The Taeryong River RegionThe Taeryong River hydroelectric power station series is probably the most mature of the three major riverine systems in this quadrant of North Korea. There are four dams with associated power stations on the river, all constructed before 2004, save one, which was completed in 2006. It is also the shortest of the rivers discussed, and there is no evidence of new dam construction. The river's system or series of dams is similar to the Chongchon River and Huichon Power Stations. The first dam, the Taechon Power Station Dam, is large in design, creating a sizeable reservoir behind it. A large substation\/transformer yard is located 600 m to its south. Taechon Power Plant No. 1 was originally located at the base of the dam, but sometime prior to 2003, a decision was made to replace the station with another, Taechon Power Plant No. 2, whose generators reside inside an underground facility, with water flowing through tunnels to power its turbines. Adjacent to where the outflow can be observed is the substation\/transformer yard.Figure 1. Taechon Power Station Dam Overview, October 17, 2017.\n\n             Figure 2. Taechon Power Plant No. 2, October 17, 2017.\n\n             The next three dams and power stations are medium-sized, beginning with one located at Taechon Youth Power Station No. 3, followed by one located at Jinnam-ri, the Taechon Youth Power Station No. 4, which is also the newest of the four, and one at Pakchon, Taechon Youth Power Station No. 5. The Taeryong River joins the Chongchon River just southeast of Pakchon and continues a short distance to the sea. Below Pakchon, the terrain is relatively flat, making the area unsuitable for the construction of dams. The Taechon power stations provide power, both locally and to the national grid. (See the Global Energy Network Institute map of North Korea's electrical power grid, updated in 2012, depict three Taechon Power stations being operationally tied into the grid.)Figure 3. Overview of North Korea's electrical power grid.\n\n Global Energy Network Institute, updated 2012.\n\n             Figure 4. Taechon Youth Power Station No. 3, October 17, 2017.\n\n             Figure 5. Taechon Youth Power Station No. 4, May 1, 2019.\n\n             Figure 6. Taechon Youth Power Station No. 5, March 2, 2019.\n\n             Jangja River RegionThe pattern of the hydroelectric power stations along the Jangja River bears some resemblance to those along the Chongchon River. They are mostly small-to-medium-sized dams, each with an associated power station, the lone exception being the Jangjagang Power Station Dam, where both the reservoir and dam are significant in size. While most of these power stations and dams were constructed prior to 2009, two are more recent in construction, and one was still under construction as of February 2019.The series of power stations begin upriver, near the city of Kanggye, where the Jangja and a large tributary join. A large, additional dam is located approximately 65 km farther to the east, near the town of Ryongrim, where the Ryongrim Reservoir and Dam are located. The dam itself has no associated power station located with it, however, the reservoir was created to support Huichon Power Station No. 1, located on Chongchon River. The water of the reservoir flows through underground penstocks, which tunnel through approximately 26 km of mountainous terrain. The diversion of water to the south and the severe drought North Korea has been experiencing has left the Jangja riverbed below the Ryongrim Dam in a relatively dry state. It is not until other tributaries begin to feed into the river farther downstream that the water flow begins to increase. However, the confluence of a large tributary meeting the Jangja southeast of Jonchon and another joining at Kanggye is what creates the volume of water needed to power the series of hydroelectric dams west of the city. The first of the dams, Hungju Youth Power Station No. 1, is located approximately 3.5 km to the north. (Note: 10 km south of Kanggye, there is ongoing grading occurring along the riverbank, which may be an indicator of early site preparations for another dam.)Figure 7. Ryongrim Dam and Reservoir, November 15, 2018.\n\n             Figure 8. Hungju Youth Power Station No. 1, February 21, 2019.\n\n             Moving southwest along the Jangja River, 3 km from Hungju Youth Power Station No. 1, is another hydroelectric dam under construction. The yet-to-be-named dam is located at 40.97926N, 126.5354E. Construction on its generator hall is ongoing, and three turbines are visible within its confines. While imagery coverage of the area is sparse, an image taken in 2013 revealed no signs of construction activity, but subsequent imagery taken in late 2017 and in early 2018 revealed that dam construction was well underway. By February 21, 2019, construction of the generator hall can be seen.Figure 9. Unnamed Dam, February 21, 2019.\n\n             The naming convention for the hydroelectric power stations located between Kanggye and the Jangjagang Power Station's reservoir was established before 2009, and it is the next two dams which bear the names of Hungju Youth Power Stations Nos. 2 and 3. Power Station No. 2 is the second oldest and has been mentioned in at least two reports over the years. It is one of two hydroelectric power stations singled out for operating normally under North Korea's recent drought conditions. The second is called out in a KCNA article from June 1, 2007, titled \"Kim Jong Il Provides Guidance to Industry Establishments in Kanggye.\" In that report, Kim references the Hungju Youth Power Station No. 2 as being completed and then goes on to mention a Power Station No. 3 being under construction. Youth Power Station No. 2 is located near Ssangbu-dong; Youth Power Station No. 3 is adjacent to Yonghung-ri. Images taken in May 2009 and March 2010 show the dam construction well underway. The next available coverage is in May 2014, which revealed its generator hall under construction. While the Hungju Youth Power Station No. 3 is now complete, the project took six years to finish despite being visited by Kim Jong Il.Figure 10. Hungju Youth Power Station No. 2, February 21, 2019.\n\n             Figure 11. Hungju Youth Power Station No. 3, February 21, 2019.\n\n             Twenty-five km west of Hungju Youth Power Station No. 3 is the large Jangjagang Power Station Reservoir. The dam itself is located at the western end of the reservoir. It is a large concrete structure, built at a time when the DPRK favored the construction of large power stations, such as those found at Huichon and Taechon. The dam itself has no readily identifiable generator hall, so it is likely that the generator turbines are located underground on the north side of the dam. There is one large building, located at the dam's base, which appears to be derelict, lacking a roof. An early image of the building, taken in 2003, shows a 60 percent roof covering, which has since fallen away. The building's location and size suggest it may have been the original generator hall for the dam, but like the power plant at the Taechon Power Station Dam, it was discarded in favor of a more protected, underground facility. Suggesting the location of such a facility, an outflow of water can be seen emanating from a tunnel entrance at the river's edge of the north bank, just below the dam, and located on the hillside above the outlet is a substation\/transformer yard.Figure 12. Jangjagang Power Station, February 21, 2019.\n\n             Less than 5 km downstream from the reservoir is the final hydroelectric power station on the river, the Yonha Power Station and dam. Small in size, it was observed under construction in 2003 and was completed sometime between then and 2007, the time of the next available image.Figure 13. Yonha Power Station, March 4, 2019.\n\n             ConclusionThe DRPK is clearly working toward solving its electrical energy needs, and hydroelectric power generation continues to expand, principally with the emphasis on building small-to-medium-sized hydroelectric dams. The first two parts of this study have reviewed three major riverine systems in the northwest providences. The Taeryong is the most mature. All of its hydroelectric dams were completed over a decade ago, and it appears the river is at its capacity in terms of their numbers. The Chongchon holds the most power stations, boasting 12, more than half of which have been constructed in the last 5 years, significantly adding to the country's electrical energy capacity. Yet another medium-sized dam is under construction just south of the last of the tiered dams, 4.5 km northwest of Kaechon. Adding another beyond this point along the river is not likely, as the terrain to the south is not favorable for the construction of hydroelectric dams. The Jangja offers the most opportunity for growth. While many of its power stations were constructed during the same period of those built on the Taeryong River, evidence of new construction is emerging, suggesting that there is yet room for growth.References\"Kim Jong Il Provides Guidance to Industry Establishments in Kanggye.\"KCNA.

The next report will focus on the northeast, where Kim Jong Un has placed great emphasis on developing that region\u2019s economy. Each of these areas has seen a rise in hydroelectric power station construction; some large, but the majority are small-to-medium in size. Coupled with the renewed emphasis on expanding the country\u2019s thermal electric power capacity, integrating them both into a viable national electricity grid will be the final challenge.\n\n North Korea has faced persistent challenges in generating sufficient electricity to meet its industrial and civil needs.

{"title":"Modernization and Expansion Project at the  Korean People\u2019s Army Fishery Station No. 15","body":null,"content":"North Korea's fishing industry occupies a critical role in the nations economy and social fabric. Its role in the nations economy, particularly its foreign currency earning operations, led to the international prohibition of seafood imports (including fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and other aquatic invertebrates in all forms) from North Korea in UN Security Council Resolution 2371 in August 2017. Socially, while fish represent a primary staple in the diet of both North and South Koreans, for the North it occupies a more critical position having facilitated the populations survival through the tumultuous economic collapse and famines of the 1990s and more recently through wide swings in agricultural production.Since the August 2017 UN sanctions, the U.S. added unilateral sanctions of the North Korean fishing industry on September 21, 2017 through 13810 Executive Order. On December 22, 2017, the UN Security Council passed resolution 2397, further clarifying the sanctions also prohibit North Korea from selling or transferring, directly or indirectly, fishing rights. The U.S. then added its own unilateral actions prohibiting the purchase of fishing rights from North Korea on January 3, 2017 with the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), PL 115-44. Enforcement of these international sanctions on North Korean seafood should be expected, therefore, to have an impact on both North Korea's baseline fisheries earnings and the expected future return on the regime's investment of resources and strategic effort to modernize its fishing industry.International sanctions come in the midst of a far-reaching strategic effort to develop North Korea's fishing industry, an effort most recently reinforced in North Korea's summer 2017 Cabinet Plenum meeting. The meetings directed the Ministry of Fisheries to expand existing modernization plans for the nations fishing infrastructure. Along with directions to fulfill existing fishing vessel production and construction of a loach production base, the ministry was directed to undertake a number of projects on the east coast. While these projects did not include Fishery Station No. 15, which is under the KPA, they included the modernization of the Sinpo Canned Fish Plant and construction of a general fishing tackle production base on the east coast.1Fishery operations in North Korea are administered under two parallel but separate organizational structures by the Ministry of Fisheries and certain units of the KPA. The KPA operates a series of fishery stations that reportedly provide fish for the KPA, residents in the capital city of Pyongyang and, more significantly, for international sale and foreign currency earning operations. Among the more frequently mentioned KPA fishery stations mentioned in the North Korean media during the past five years are:2Fishery Station No. 18 (Wonsan-si), under KPA Unit No. 5673Fishery Station No. 15 (Namsong-ni), under KPA No. Unit 549Raksan Offshore Salmon Fish Farm, under KPA No. Unit 810August 25 Fishery Station (Tongchon-up), under KPA Unit No. 313January 8 Fishery Station, under KPA Unit No. 534May 27 Fishery Station, under KPA No. Unit 534.Ministry of Fisheries control extends down through Provincial Fishery Management Bureaus to large fishery stations (i.e., Nampho [Nampo] Fishery Station, Kimchaek Fishery Station, etc.), Distant-Sea Fishery Complexes and small local fishing concerns (i.e., small-scale fishing stations) along both coasts and inland lakes and rivers.4 The Ministry of Fisheries also operates a number of national level bureaus (e.g., Fish Farming Management, etc.), laboratories, and institutes (e.g., Institute of Fishery, etc.) to support the industry.5 It apparently also operates, or oversees operations at, an unknown number of fishing boat construction and repair facilities (some of which are associated with provincial fishing stations).6The KPA has always operated a second economy in parallel with the domestic economy. Reforms that started with events of the 1990s have continued to evolve since Kim Jong-un assumed power and the KPA has devoted a greater effort than it had historically to food production and foreign currency earning.Kim Jong-un also taken a more proactive role in both praising and criticizing economic projects. The level of praise Kim has specifically granted to the KPA's fisheries has been notable and evidenced by the number of visits and on-the-spot guidance trips taken by Kim and other high-level KPA and Worker Party of Korea (WPK) officials reported by state media.7 Annual worker ceremonies also celebrate the achievements of the so-called activists in fisheries under the KPA. These annual events appear to have reached new heights in 2013 and were reported in 2014,8 2015,9 and 201610 to applaud fulfillment of fishery production goals.Fishery Station No. 15Since 2015, a new and significant modernization and expansion project has been underway at Fishery Station No. 15 on North Korea's east coast, 8.7 km east of the port city of Wonsan-si, in the village of Namsong-ni, Anbyon-gun, Kangwon-do. The fishery, operated under KPA Unit No. 549, was reportedly inaugurated in 1972. However, a declassified satellite image acquired on December 8, 1974 of Namsong-ni shows elements of a tiny village but no indication of any significant fishing activity. If the 1972 date is correct, then Fishery Station No. 15 may have been located elsewhere potentially in Wonsan at that time.\n\nAn overview of the Namsong-ni area showing no indications of significant fishing activity. (CIA, Declassified KH-7 image from KH-7 mission 1207, December 8, 1974).\n             Little open source information is readily available concerning the stations development or operations prior to 2015, except that Kim Jong-il had once visited it. Satellite imagery from 2002-2014, however, provides some insight. By 2002, the village of Namsong-ni had grown considerably and Fishery Station No. 15 was well established. Satellite imagery generally available in Google Earth shows during the next 13 years the station was generally active with fluctuating numbers of fishing vessels present and minor infrastructure changes typical of what would be expected to be seen along the coasts of North Korea. The facility encompassed approximately 10 hectares and consisted of approximately 24-26 buildings (split between a main facility and what appears to be a small support compound 100 meters to the northeast), a 165-meter-long wharf, the partial remains of an old pier to the northeast, and a rudimentary shipyard and single repair way for fishing vessels. A crude 55-meter-long pier, immediately to the west of the facility was present in 2002 but was razed sometime in 2012. In 2014, a minor renovation took place at the station during which a new building was erected, three buildings had new roofs installed, the yards and wharf were resurfaced, and decking was placed on the old pier to the northeast allowing for regular light use.Satellite imagery from April 24, 2015, prior to Kim Jong-uns first visit, shows the facility as it looked before the start of the subsequent multi-year modernization and expansion program. The station encompassed approximately 10 hectares with approximately 32 buildings.\n\n             Although it is not definitively known, it is likely that Fishery Station No. 15 and other KPA fishery stations began benefiting during 2015 from ongoing research being conducted by elements of the Ministry of Fisheries into establishing a system to support a fishing ground search using satellite information.11 This system may be what is later identified as the maritime environment information analysis and assessment system.12 Exactly which satellites this system uses is unknown, however, there are a number of free international satellite repositories that would be beneficial for this type of work. Such a system was apparently in use the following year when it was reported that, Water temperature transmission system based on satellite information, system for detecting fishing ground and a program for estimating hard-finned sandfish fishery have been introduced into fishery stations and fishing boats under the Ministry of Fisheries.13Modernization and Expansion of Fishery Station No. 15On November 24, 2015, two days after a trip to the August 25 Fishery Station under KPA Unit 313, Kim Jong-un undertook a field guidance trip to Fishery Station No. 15 under KPA Unit 549.14 Here he congratulated the officials and employees of the station for making a big haul to satisfy the Supreme Commanders desire to supply fishes to the service persons every day and supplying fresh fishes to the soldiers in all seasons. Kim's visit to the station was, reportedly, not only to congratulate it on its achievements but also to provide a fresh turning point in the work of the station. This fresh turning point initiated a sweeping multi-year modernization and expansion program. Among the areas to be addressed under this program were: construction of a new breakwater and wharf; introduction of new fishing and processing technology onshore and on the stations fishing vessels; expansion of the flash-freezing and refrigerating facilities; expansion of mechanization in unloading, sorting, freezing, and storage operations; improved maintenance and repair of fishing vessels; modernization of all production buildings; and improved housing and leisure facilities for members and their families. While outside technical assistance would be forthcoming, much of the physical labor would be undertaken by the officials and employees of the station with assistance from Unit No. 549. The ultimate goals of these projects were to enable it to catch, process, and deliver a greater tonnage of processed fish in fulfillment of newly established goals.\n\nKim Jong-un standing front of a stylized drawing of Fishery Station No. 15 prior to its modernization. Although this drawing does not show the small compound and old pier to the northeast, satellite imagery clearly shows their use by the fishery station, (Rodong Sinmun, November 25, 2015).\n\nKim Jong-un walking along the original wharf at Fishery Station No. 15 prior to its expansion (Rodong Sinmun, November 25, 2015).\n             Satellite imagery indicates that the modernization program began quickly shortly after Kim's visit. By March 23, 2016, many of the stations existing buildings had been razed and excavations for the foundations for the new processing plant and other buildings were being excavated. Work had also begun on expanding and modernizing the main wharf. By August 17, 2016, the station had expanded to encompass approximately 14 hectares due to the arrival of hundreds of concrete caissons, blocks and tetrapods for expansion and construction of wharfs, and a seawall. The new processing plant, shipyard with repair shops and storerooms,15 and approximately nine other buildings were externally completed. Several monuments had also been erected. However, several other buildings were still under construction and the stations roads and parking areas had yet to be graded and paved. Approximately 34 buildings were completed or under construction and numerous construction vehicles were present throughout the station. Large fishing vessels were present along the northeast pier, main wharf and on the repair way. At the end of the following month, several additional buildings were externally complete, and work was slowly proceeding on the main wharf. On February 26, 2016, a total of 12 large fishing vessels were present along the northeast pier, main wharf and outside the repair way. This has been the largest number observed at any one time at the station and was likely related to the impending start of the years first 70-day campaign to greet the historic Seventh Congress of the Workers Party of Korea with unprecedented labor achievements.16\n\n             On December 14, 2016, a year after his first visit, Kim Jong-un returned to the Fishery Station No. 15 for a second On-the-Spot-Guidance inspection both to congratulate the unit on fulfilling the annual fishing plan 170 percent and to assess progress with the modernization program.17 During his visit, Kim inspected the stations production facilities and fishing vessels, was briefed on the modernization and expansion programs progress, and emphasized the importance of transforming the station by the informatization and the scientization [sic] of production and business activities to bring it into the era of [a] knowledge-based economy.18 Once again, he set annual fish production goals for the station and stated that his father, Kim Jong-il, would be pleased if the fish caught by the peoples army were sent to the citizens of the capital city.19 (As of August 2018, Kim is not reported to have revisited Fishery Station No. 15.)\n\nKim Jong-un in front of the Daanpoong No. 5 (Autumn Foliage No. 5) fishing boat of Fishery Station No. 15 (Rodong Sinmun, December 15, 2016).20\n             Satellite imagery from March 28, 2017, shows that steady progress had been made on the main station facilities. There were now approximately 29 buildings, construction of a new greenhouse had begun, the roads and parking areas had been graded and paved, the main wharf had been expanded to 240-meters-long, and nine large fishing vessels were present. By November 4, 2017, the infrastructure of the main facility (including the new greenhouse) was complete, the main wharf had been extended to its final length of 325-meters, a new 60-meter-long jetty had been built to the west of the station, and construction of a long seawall had started. At the northeast pier, an 18-meter-long concrete and earth ramp was built out over the old framework. No large fishing vessels were present.\n\n             The following year would witness continuing development and expansion of Fishery Station No. 15. By January 20, 2018, work had progressed to lengthen the jetty to approximately 75-meters-long, seawall construction continued slowly, and the concrete and earth ramp at the northeast pier had been extended to 40-meters-long. Ten large fishing vessels were present.Five months later, on June 6, 2018, dramatic changes had occurred. With work on the main station infrastructure completed construction moved into a second phase focused on adding new infrastructure and housing. A new wharf was under construction 200 meters west of the station and was now 125-meters-long and work continued on a seawall, that will eventually be at least 300-meters-long. Immediately behind the new wharf and seawall, a large area had been cleared and graded, and construction of several new buildings begun. Five large fishing vessels were present. Within the village of Namsong-ni, all the dwellings with a large 5.5-hectare area immediately south of the station had been razed and 29 new housing units (potentially apartment buildings) were under construction.21As of July 26, 2018, Fishery Station No. 15 had expanded to encompass approximately 22.5-hectares, construction had continued on both the new wharf, which was now 175-meters-long, and the seawall. The jetty that had been erected during 2017 was removed, the seawall has been widened and extended, and the area immediately behind has continued to be developed. Work continues on the new wharf, which will likely continue to be extended to create a protected boat basin. Six large fishing vessels are present (two of which are on the repair way). Within the village of Namsong-ni, construction on the new housing units slowly continued and most foundations and first-floor walls have been completed. Satellite imagery clearly indicates that the development of Fishery Station No. 15 is scheduled to continue for the remainder of 2018 and potentially into 2019.\n\n             Production and OperationsNorth Korean media reports indicate that Fishery Station No. 15 facilities includes:22pickling tanks;freezing storehouses;processing shop with an automated conveyor belt and robotization at a high level;a combined control room with maritime environment information analysis and assessment system, maritime command system, processing equipment control system, and electric power monitoring system;revolutionary history education room, history introduction room, the cultural hall, science and technology dissemination room, and a medical center; andemployee housing.North Korean media reports indicate Fishery Station No. 15 produces pickled and frozen seafood products. Open-source reports are not available on the precise types of fish caught and processed by Fishery Station No. 15. However, seafood commonly caught off North Korea's east coast include cod, Japanese amberjack (yellowtail), Alaskan pollock, assorted varieties of mackerel, Japanese sandfish, herring, anchovy, sardine, Pacific saury, red snow crab, and flounder.23\n\nPickling tanks at Fishery Station No. 15 with salt pile on right (Rodong Sinmun, November 25, 2015).\n\nKim Jong-un in a freezer surrounded by blocks of frozen fish (Rodong Sinmun, November 25, 2015).\n             North Korean media reports fishing methods utilized by the KPA and Ministry of Fisheries include gill-net, cage-net fish farming, purse, set-net, and trawling. KPA operations are conducted collectively or separately with small or large boats in distant or nearby seas.24North Korean fishing industry's critical role in the nations economy, particularly its foreign currency earning operations, led to a series of recent international sanctions starting with an August 2017 UN Security Council prohibition of North Korean seafood imports. Concurrently, since 2015, a significant modernization and expansion project has been underway at the Korean Peoples Army (KPA) Fishery Station No. 15 on North Korea's east coast. Satellite imagery clearly indicates the development of Fishery Station No. 15, a multi-year modernization and expansion project, which is scheduled to continue for the remainder of 2018 and potentially into 2019.While the data is incomplete, some preliminary insights into its operations may be derived by reviewing the number of large fishing vessels (25-30 meter-long) present in satellite imagery at Fishery Station No. 15. The highest number of large shipping vessels present appears to be at the beginning of a fishing campaign (i.e., season). With the exception of the period when the stations shipyard was being rebuilt, there have been an average of 1.2 larger fishing vessels on the repair ways. This indicates either a proactive program of maintenance and repair, or a low-level of preventive maintenance.Of the dates available for analysis, the fewest number of large fishing vessels were observed on November 3 and 4, 2017, recording 1 and 0 vessels respectively. This was apparently due to the end of the winter fishing season and the effort to fulfill or exceed catch and production quotas.25The high number (average of 7.2) large fishing vessels present on almost every date observed may suggest a low supply of fuel, a pattern of only sending the fleet out as a group (for security and efficiency), or some other factor. These numbers may be skewed by the possible introduction of additional fishing vessels or the loan of vessels from other fishery stations.Fishing Vessels Present at Fishery Station No. 15 26\n\n         The activity observed at Fishery Station No. 15 over the past three years probably indicates this project is more than a basic modernization and expansion of a single fishery station. Rather it may be a component of a far-reaching strategic effort to develop North Korea's fishing industry, an effort recently reinforced by declarations from the summer 2017 Cabinet Plenum. Enforcement of international sanctions on North Korean seafood should be expected, therefore, to have an impact on both North Korea's baseline fisheries earnings and the expected future return on the regime's investment of resources and strategic effort in this modernization project.References and Notes1.

References  \n\n The degree to which international sanctions on North Korean seafood and sale of fishing rights are enforced will largely determine the impact such a regime can be expected to have on North Korea's fishing industry. Should news reports of relaxed sanctions enforcement or of an uptick of fish transfers at sea increase, the North Korean fishing industry, including the KPA's Fishing Station No. 15, will see a reduced impact on their foreign currency earning capabilities. Looking ahead for the status of the ongoing modernization and expansion projects, any one of, or any combination thereof, the following would indicate a strategic decision to further develop the fishery station. This would likely be a continuation, or expansion, of the existing national level fishery expansion plan that was instituted several years ago by Kim Jong-un. \n\n The fishing industry\u2019s critical role in North Korea\u2019s economy, particularly its foreign currency earning operations, led to a series of international sanctions on North Korean seafood. \n\n Concurrently, significant modernization and expansion has been underway since 2015 at the KPA's Fishery Station No. 15 on the east coast.

Kim's visit to the station was, reportedly, not only to congratulate it on its achievements but also to provide a fresh turning point in the work of the station. This fresh turning point initiated a sweeping multi-year modernization and expansion program. Among the areas to be addressed under this program were: construction of a new breakwater and wharf; introduction of new fishing and processing technology onshore and on the stations fishing vessels; expansion of the flash-freezing and refrigerating facilities; expansion of mechanization in unloading, sorting, freezing, and storage operations; improved maintenance and repair of fishing vessels; modernization of all production buildings; and improved housing and leisure facilities for members and their families. \n\n KPA's Fishery Station No. 15 Pre-Modernization and Expansion Status \n\n Station encompassed approximately 10 hectares with approximately 32 buildings.","authors":["Joseph Bermudez","Marie DuMond"],"categories":["North Korea's Economy"],"tags":["army","csis","fish","fishing","military","sanctions","wonsan"],"url":"http:\/\/www.tearline.mil\/public_page\/modernization-and-expansion-project-at-the-korean-peoples-army-fishery-station-no-15\/","id":null}
{"title":"A Snapshot of North Korea\u2019s Supply Chain Coal Activity \u2013 Part II","body":null,"content":"Based on an initial look at North Korea's coal industry, the country's larger coal mines have remained active despite the increasing restrictions on the North's coal exports. Part I of this report examined two areas of North Korea's coal industry: 1) its mining in the South Pyongan region, and 2) its rail coal transfer stations located along the Taedong River, which flows through the region. This report (Part II) examines two key coal ports and the rail transfer yards along the Chinese and Russian borders.While a degree of ambiguity resides with the activities observed at each of these facilities, the coal ports and border rail transfer yards remain a key component in monitoring compliance with UN Security Council resolutions; it may also provide indicators as to how aggressively the DRPK is executing Kim Jong Un's guidance to redirect the country's coal toward meeting its domestic energy needs.Coal Ports and Border Rail Classification YardsExport activity can be observed and monitored at two of North Korea's larger ports and at two of the smaller ports designated as coal ports. To a lesser extent, rail classification yards located at or near key border cities can also be monitored to some degree, but because trains are more fleeting, and ore cars may be staged in a loaded or unloaded state, determining how much coal is being moved through these yards is difficult to assess. When present, stockpiles of coal in the yard area can provide an indicator of activity, as piles grow or shrink in volume.In Part I, we examined the Sunchon Coal Port located northeast of Pyongyang on the Taedong River, and the Ryongchon Coal Port, located at the mouth of the Yalu River south of the Chinese city of Dandong. In Part II, we focus on Nampo, the largest west coast port servicing the Pyongyang area, located on the mouth of the Taedong River, and Rajin, a medium-sized port, located on the east coast near the Russian border.NampoWhile not specifically a coal port, Nampo has within its facilities a large coal-transfer\/bunkering quay area. The majority of large, bulk cargo exports of coal originates from there. Monitoring shipping from the port has revealed trends which track closely with developments on the sanctions front, but with some interesting oddities.Figure 1. Overview of the Nampo Port, February 2019.\n\n             From the period between February 2016 to January 2017, it was common to observe three large bulk cargo vessels at the quay and bunkering pier; three large ships being the maximum capacity. On February 18, 2017, however, only one 5-hold cargo ship was present, and a general trend of one or no vessels was observed over the next couple years as late as February 24, 2019, when only a 3-hold bulk carrier was present. However, in imagery from March 13, 2019, no vessels were present, but 21 coal cars were positioned at the bulk ore storage area, and approximately 25 more were observed in the adjacent rail yard. While the presence of vessels seems to have been reduced significantly, shipping has not stopped, and throughout this period, the probable coal stores on the wharf, while shifting in size and placement, have remained robust.Figure 2. Probable coal stores in bunkering areas at Nampo, February 24, 2019.\n\n             RajinRajin serves a unique role as both a transshipment port for overseas import\/export trade and also as a terminus for the Rajin-Khasan Railway, which provides a land link between North Korea and Russia. Russia, a coal exporter itself, has sought to open a port to gain easier access to both Japan and South Korea. In a trade agreement with North Korea, Russia invested nearly $30 million to refurbish the pier and rail line to Khasan, making it into a more capable international transshipment facility.The Rajin port has three large wharfs\/quays. The southern-most pier, Pier 3, and an adjacent, separately-secured storage area serviced by a rail, was leased by the Russians in 2008 (for 50 years) and serves as a shore-to-ship coal transfer facility. However, major investment to improve the infrastructure to this port did not begin until around August 2011, following a series of visits by Kim Jong Il to China and Russia to seek economic cooperation. In imagery from March 4, 2011, there were no indications that Rajin was to be a coal transfer port. By February 2016, what appear to be coal deposits are present on Pier 3's quay and in the adjacent, separately-walled, open storage area. Also a large bulk cargo vessel is docked at the quay.It should be noted that in March 2016, Seoul informed Moscow that it was suspending the Rajin-Khasan logistics project aimed at transporting coal from Russia to South Korea via North Korea, despite special exemptions for this cooperation in UN Security Council Resolution 2270. At that time, only three shipments had been made along the 54-kilometer route between Khasan to Rajin, aimed at delivery to South Korea.Infrequent coverage followed until March 17, 2018, when the coal stores were no longer seen in the Russian-leased areas. Instead, piles of probable coal were located on the quay of Pier 2 and on the quay between the piers. Five images from then until February 8, 2019, show no other changes, and only one cargo vessel was observed at the quay during that period.Despite five images of Rajin in 2018, a cargo vessel was observed only once, but the coal stores on quays have remained constant and significant in volume. No coal trains were observed at the adjacent rail spur during this period either, although unlike cargo ships which may take several days to load, trains can load and unload quickly, and therefore, are more fleeting.Figure 3. Probable coal on quays at Rajin coal port, February 8, 2019.\n\n             These observations track closely with the issuance of numerous UN sanctions resolutions as well as Seoul's decision to not allow vessels that had been docked in North Korean ports into South Korean ports. As such, the Russian coal stores became rapidly depleted, but began showing up in large quantities on Pier 2 and the quay area between the two piers. The appearance of probable coal stocks on these other quays is intriguing, as they only appeared after the closure of the Russian areas.There are a number of reports which reference the Russian and Chinese laundering of coal shipments. With regard to Russia, coal has been and is being moved by ship to two ports near Vladivostok, Kholmsk and Nakhodka. From there, it is transloaded onto Russian ships for sales to Japan and South Korea, and presumably other countries as well. Nampo, Wonsan and Chongjin were specifically named in those reports, but Rajin could also be in the mix.Coal can be moved from the Rajin coal port by rail to Russia via the Rajin-Khasan Railway, although nothing has been observed on satellite imagery to support this is taking place. The North Korean rail lines follow the Tumen River, and the original vision for the Rajin-Khasan Railway was to have included China in the trading arrangement. As such, North Korea could attempt to export its coal through other crossing points such as the Namyang to Tumen crossing point.Sinuiju Classification YardsThe Sinuiju classification yards are located on the east side of the rail\/auto bridge, referred to as the Friendship Bridge, which crosses the Yalu River, connecting Dandong, China with Sinuiju, North Korea. Reportedly, it has been used for the export\/import of goods between the long-time allies and trading partners, including coal.A brief review of imagery taken from between March 2015 to March 23, 2019, showed a general downward trend of ore cars present in the yard. From March 3, 2015 to April 10, 2017, the number of ore cars present ranged from 30 to 70. However, in imagery from November 24, 2017, there was a significant drop to only about a dozen ore cars, all empty. Their numbers grew briefly in February 2018, when 30 to 50 ore cars were observed on three successive images, all empty. By May 4, 2018, and continuing through March 23, 2019, the numbers decreased again with only a dozen or fewer probable ore cars observed at a time, although there were tens of passenger and box cars seen throughout this period.These dates tend to coincide with when China claimed it refused coal imports from the DPRK. However, the reason for the brief increase in ore cars in February 2018 is not fully understood. It is noteworthy that there is a large covered platform section of tracks, which may serve as a passenger terminal, and which conceals a portion of the yard activity in winter months due to sun shadows.Figure 4. Overview of Sinuiju Rail Yards, December 23, 2016.\n\n             Figure 5. Overview of Sinuiju Rail Yards, November 13, 2018.\n\n             Tumangang Classification YardsThe rail yards are located near a rail bridge crossing the Tumen River, which connects Tumangang, North Korea with Khasan, Russia. Reportedly, this crossing has been the principal route for moving coal ore from Khasan to Rajin.Coverage of the yard is limited between August 27, 2017, when tens of ore cars were observed in the yard, to November 29, 2017, when no ore cars were present. This change in activity coincides with the passing of the UN Security Council resolution, and the absence of coal on the Russian-leased pier at Rajin Port.In images between April 2018 to February 7, 2019, rail car activity was again observed, but most appeared to be box and tank cars. With such a small sample, a trend cannot be fully assessed but the possibility of coal cars quickly passing through should not be dismissed either.Figure 6. Overview of Tumangang classification yards and proximity to Russia.\n\n             Figure 7. Close up of Tumangang rail classification yard.\n\n             Figure 8. Close up of Tumangang rail staging yard.\n\n             Figure 9. Lack of ore cars at Tumangang rail yards, November 29, 2017.\n\n             Other Border Classification YardsSinuiju is not the only rail crossing point from North Korea into China. Namyang to Tumen, Chongsu, and Manpo were also examined. While the latter two may be used, there was no clear evidence of either coal cars (full or empty) staged on the North Korean side of the crossings and\/or stores of coal piled at the yards to be loaded, albeit ore cars were observed at Manpo.The exception is the Namyang to Tumen, China crossing point, where there has been considerable imagery covering the area from May 2017 to February 2019. During this time, while coal stores have not been observed in the Namyang rail yards, Tumen has several large coal storage areas. The probable coal ore in those areas has increased and diminished throughout the period examined, although from August 2018 to February 2019, the overall stores appear increasingly depleted. Whether this is a function of transfers being made and simply not detected on the North Korean side is unclear, but this area merits continued monitoring.ReferencesChan, Tara Francis. \"North Korea Reportedly 'Laundered' Coal Through Russia in Apparent Breach of Sanctions.\" Business Insider.

{"title":"North Korea's Hydroelectric Power \u2013 Part I","body":null,"content":"BackgroundCoal and hydropower are the two main sources of power in North Korea, however, hydropower accounts for the majority of the country's actual electricity production.1 During the Kim Jong Il era, North Korea had embarked on an ambitious plan to build large hydroelectric power stations across the country, each capable of generating enough electricity to power and light its major urban areas. The centerpiece of that plan was the Huichon Power Station, the largest to be built in North Korea, and capable of generating some 300,000 kilowatts (kW) of power, sufficient to meet the needs of its capital, Pyongyang. For Kim, Huichon was to be a symbol of North Korean pride and its peoples' ingenuity. Unfortunately, it also became a major source of frustration as climate and engineering failures seemed to conspire against the project, and Huichon has yet to achieve its output goals.Following his father's death, Kim Jong Un continued to champion the Huichon project. However, after two years and continued setbacks, he altered the country's strategic plan for energy production and shifted the focus toward building small-to-medium-sized, tiered hydroelectric power stations such as those now constructed along the Chongchon River. While these smaller power stations were originally intended to satisfy local and regional energy needs, they are now becoming a part of a larger, integrated power grid.2Status of Power StationsThis first report focuses on the construction activity at both large and small-to-medium-sized, tiered hydroelectric power stations located on the Chongchon River. In doing so, it's important to understand the climate, terrain, and engineering challenges the DPRK faces.Huichon Power Stations 1 and 2Near the headwaters of the Chongchon River and east of Huichon is where the namesake, large-scale Huichon Hydroelectric Power Station is located. The Huichon power project actually consists of two hydroelectric plants, each supported by a separate man-made reservoir, created by the placement of a large dam, one located at the headwaters of the Changja River near Ryongrim and the other east of Huichon on the Chongchon River.Huichon Station 1 is located just off the Chongchon River east of the Huichon\/Chongchon Reservoir; however, the water used to power its turbines is piped from the Ryongrim\/Changja Reservoir located approximately 30 km to the north. Station 2 is located at the base of the Huichon\/Chongchon Reservoir. Touted by Kim Jong Il as the future for hydroelectric power generation, these large reservoirs were intended to ensure that a sustained supply of water would be available to turn the generator turbines. Unfortunately, both dams have been plagued by engineering flaws and, coupled with climatic extremes, neither has achieved its intended output.Figure 1. Huichon Power Station No. 2, September 1, 2018.\n\n             Chongchon River Tiered Power StationsFrom their beginning, setbacks were common in the construction and operation of the large Huichon Power Stations, and harsh weather experienced throughout the region has impacted the efficiency of all its dams. Severe winter cold causes ice to build, constricting the flow of water and thus, slowing turbine speeds, which in turn diminishes the power output. Additionally, drought and extreme summer heat have plagued North Korea for the past two years, further impacting water levels and electrical output.The persistence of these conditions has meant that the turbines of the large power plants have been unable to meet specifications, and therefore, a change in strategy began to emerge by 2013 and was articulated publicly in Kim Jong Un's 2014 New Years Address. In his speech, Kim highlighted a new direction in hydroelectric power generation, citing a multiple tier strategy to build smaller power stations along the Chongchon River.In addressing electric power, he stated that:While taking measures for generating electricity to the maximum at existing power stations, we should draw up correct prospective plans for radically easing the strain on electricity supply and exert ourselves to carry them out. It is important to produce more electricity with priority given to hydraulic resources, and by using wind, geothermal, solar and other kinds of natural energy.Power generation, and specifically hydroelectric power plants, was a theme repeated in Kim's New Years speeches of 2015, 2016 and 2017, where he again highlighted the Chongchon River tiered system. Finally, in his 2018 address, Kim talked about focusing on area-specific electricity generation, stating:The electric power industry should maintain and reinforce the self-supporting power generation bases, and direct a great deal of efforts to developing new power sources Provinces should build power generation bases to suit their local features and put power generation at the existing medium and small-sized power station on normal footing to satisfy the needs of electric power for local industry by themselves.Figure 2. Huichon Power Station No. 3, September 1, 2018.\n\n             Figure 3. Huichon Power Station No. 4, July 24, 2018.\n\n             From Huichon Power Station 2, going south along an 80 km stretch of the Chongchon River, are a series of 10 small-sized power stations, each damming the river along the way and producing power used locally. These dams are, more or less, cookie cutter in design, although penstocks and generator halls for a couple are not collocated with their associated dams.Figure 4. Huichon Power Station No. 5, July 24, 2018.\n\n             Figure 5. Huichon Power Station No. 6, April 11, 2019.\n\n             Figure 6. Huichon Power Station No. 7, April 11, 2019.\n\n             Figure 7. Huichon Power Station No. 8, April 11, 2019.\n\n             Figure 8. Huichon Power Station No. 9, April 11, 2019.\n\n             Figure 9. Huichon Station No. 9 without collocated generator halls and penstocks.\n\n             The Chongchon River project began in 2013, and reportedly, was complete and operational by late 2015. The entire project was completed at a far faster pace than that associated with the construction of the large hydroelectric power stations. While imagery coverage of the entire stretch of the 10-plant project has been inconsistent, what is available indicates most of the construction on the dams began in 2013, but at least two dams were not started until 2014. On the latest coverage of each, they all appear complete or nearly complete, although one lacks the visible presence of a substation, and for most, limited image resolution precludes the ability to discern the presence of electric power lines.Figure 10. Huichon Power Station No. 10, February 4, 2019.\n\n             Figure 11. Huichon Power Station No. 11, February 4, 2019.\n\n             Figure 12. Huichon Power Station No. 12, November 21, 2017.\n\n             Going south from Huichon, the series of 10 dams terminates just north of Kaechon, near Pongchon-dong. Another dam project is under construction farther south near Junhyok-ri. That dam will be much wider than the others, suggesting it will create a reservoir wider than the existing river, although it is not likely to be very deep given the flat surrounding terrain. It is from this dam going south that the terrain flattens and the river meanders toward Anju and is no longer suitable for the construction of hydroelectric power plants.Figure 13. Dam under construction near Junhyok-ri, May 1, 2019.\n\n             Orangchon Power StationDespite a stronger emphasis on smaller hydroelectric power stations, there is still evidence that North Korea has not abandoned its desire to build large power stations capable of producing considerable amounts of sustained energy. For example, the large Orangchon Power Station was mentioned in a KCNA article dated May 28, 2019, stating: \"The construction progress of the Orangchon Power Station is progressing apace. Remarkable successes have been made in the reservoir construction site.\" It noted that Kim Jong Un had visited the Phalhyang Dam in July 2018 and had directed it be completed ahead of schedule. Kim's personal directives, when visiting projects of interest to him, tend to move them along more quickly. However, while progress has been noted in the most recent coverage, heavy work at the site has been ongoing since October 2016, and the project does not yet appear to be nearing completion.Figure 14. Orangchon Power Station, May 3, 2019.\n\n             Other Minor Power StationsIn addition to the Chongchon River project, other areas boast the presence of small-to-medium-scale power stations, the Changja River among them. Like those on the Chongchon River, most of the smaller power stations on the Changja River began construction around 2013 to 2014, although there is one large dam that was constructed much earlier and holds back a large reservoir close to the river mouth where it joins the Yalu River. At that dam, there is a large building that is unfinished or in disrepair; while it may have been intended to be a generator hall, construction at the site has long ceased although it is unclear as to why.The remaining, smaller dams and power stations along the river appear operational, and one, the Hungju Youth Power Station, located near Kanggye, was cited in a news article on May 31, 2019. That article titled, \"Minor Hydroelectric Power Stations Conducive to Economic Activities in the DPRK,\" discussed how a second straight year of drought and high temperatures has strained the electrical output of the country's larger hydroelectric power stations, and reiterated the move toward smaller, serial, hydroelectric dams.ConclusionThe Huichon Power Station project was a great source of pride for Kim Jong Il. In a January 1, 2012 Joint New Years editorial following his death, the beloved former leader was applauded for his great accomplishments, and the Huichon Project was cited as a reflection of that. The article stated:We should solve the problem of power shortage at all costs and on a priority basis. The sector of electric-power industry should continue to press on with the building of large-size hydropower stations and improve the operation of equipment and technical management at the existing power stations, so as to keep the generation of electricity going on a high level.That message was repeated again over the course of the year in various forums, and in Kim Jong Un's 2013 New Years address, he again highlighted the commissioning of the Huichon project, stating, \"By adopting decisive steps to shore up the vanguard sectors of the national economy and the sectors of basic industries, we should develop coal-mining, (sic) electric-power on a preferential basis and provide a firm springboard for building of an economic giant.\"Achieving those goals has ultimately become problematic. Engineering setbacks, coupled with climatic challenges, have forced North Korea to alter its energy strategy. This change was articulated in a May 2019 KCNA article, which explained that weather had impacted the output of the large-scale hydroelectric power stations, and therefore the various provinces are increasing the output of their minor hydroelectric power stations to their maximum to support regional economic activities and peoples livelihood. The article cited several minor power stations across the country, which are trying to maximize production, and concluded, \"It is the policy of the Workers' Party of Korea to build minor power stations in a practical way and ensure their normal operation for bringing substantial benefit the people.\"Explainers1. According to a 2002 study of North Korea's electricity grid by the Global Energy Network Institute, there is a distinction between energy production and electricity production. For instance, in 2000, coal accounted for 86 percent of the country's energy consumption, but hydropower accounted for 67 percent of its actual electricity production, with coal-fired thermal power accounting for only 33 percent. See North Korea, GENI.org. October 2002. https:\/\/www.geni.org\/globalenergy\/library\/national_energy_grid\/north-korea\/index.shtml.2. In a 2015 article by Leo Byrne about the completion of 10 hydropower plants, he referenced a September 2015 Korea Central Television report indicating the plants were being connected to the North Korean electricity grid. See Leo Byrne. North Korea Completes 10 Hydro Plants. NK News. November 18, 2015. https:\/\/www.nknews.org\/2015\/11\/n-korea-completes-10-hydro-plants\/. Despite that report, no electric power lines are observable on satellite imagery of the plants, although it is unclear whether this is due to limited resolution or an absence of infrastructure.References\"Construction of Orangchon Power Station Makes Headway.\" KCNA Watch.

While construction of the large hydropower stations has not been abandoned, the extreme weather conditions will continue to limit the effectiveness of these plants when operational.

{"title":"Part  2: Ore Car Activity Up at Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex","body":null,"content":"The Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex, located on the southern outskirts of the east coast port city of Wonsan, is the largest railroad rolling stock manufacturing and repair facility in North Korea. Commercial satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe collected on July and October 2018, as well as ground imagery released by North Korean media, indicates that the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex remains operational and is actively engaged in the manufacture of new ore cars, probable refurbishment or repair of additional ore cars, and the repair or production of general freight and passenger rail cars.When compared to satellite images from earlier in 2018, the images from July and October show continued shifting of railcars, changing sizes and composition of materials in open storage areas, and no significant construction or demolition of buildings within the complex. As with previous summer and fall imagery of the complex the extensive use of open spaces for gardening is apparent.1\n\n             The imagery from July 26 and October 30, 2018 shows that the total number of railcars observed at the complex remains in between the high and low numbers presented in our earlier report with approximately 74 visible in the July 26 images and 63 visible in the October 30 images. Ore cars dominate those observed at the complex with approximately 32 (43%) being present on July 26 and 25 (39%) visible on October 30.2 The remaining rail cars present consists of box cars, tank cars, flat cars, locomotives, and unknown (a category that is due to cars that are partially obscured by structures, in shadows, or where the resolution is insufficient to made a clear determination).The continued dominance of ore cars at the complex is likely both a reflection of the nations emphasis upon the extractive industries (e.g., coal) and the need to replace or refurbish heavily used rail cars that have received little or no routine maintenance. Ore cars can be seen in both images not only in the holding yards but dispersed around the complex near the paint shops, assembly halls, and shops. (See more images in Timeline section).\n\n             The presence of over 200 logs floating in the log basin in the July 26 image and the absence of those logs in the October 30 image strongly suggests that there was a production or repair program involving freight and\/or passenger cars during July through October. These types of rail cars make extensive use of wood, while most other rail cars produced at the complex primarily use steel, iron, and aluminum. (See more images in Timeline section). This supposition may be supported by an image published in Nodong Sinmun on August 3, 2018 that shows passenger cars being manufactured at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex.\n\n                Passenger cars being manufactured at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex, Nodong Sinmun, August 3, 2018\n             References and Notes1.

{"title":"Making Solid Tracks: North Korea's Railway Connections with China and Russia","body":null,"content":"Inter-Korean railway cooperation in 2018 was initiated by the April 27 Panmunjom Declaration. 1 Signed on April 27, 2018 by South Korean president Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after the first 2018 inter-Korean summit, the Panmunjom Declaration includes an agreement to implement various infrastructure projects outlined by the 2007 October 4 inter-Korean agreement. Inter-Korean exchanges throughout the summer and fall continued to re-affirm joint commitment to railway cooperation. Inter-Korean railway cooperation in 2018 culminated in a December 26 groundbreaking ceremony at the Panmun station on the east side of the Kaesong Industrial Complex.President Moon has also been building on South Korea's longstanding, albeit intermittent, conversations and aspirational cooperation commitments with China and Russia to plan for future integration of their railway networks. The Organization for Cooperation of Railways (OSJD) June 2018 approval of South Korea's membership now allows South Korea to participate in the Trans-China Railway and the Trans-Siberian Railway. However, physical track infrastructure varies greatly, signal systems differ, and clearances for stations are not compatible. Supporting infrastructure such as communication, energy grids, and even emergency response systems also need to be modernized and harmonized. These projects will all be costly and time intensive.Comparing Track SystemsWhile South Korea and China use standard 1,435 mm gauge track, Russia uses a gauge of 1,520 mm.2 The North Korean systems use a range of gauge widths, but 87 percent of its tracks are 1,435 mm.3 Train speeds are slower in North Korea than in South Korea due to irregular maintenance and old technology.4 However, the actual design speeds also differ between the two systems. South Korean tracks range from 70 to 350 kilometer per hour while North Korean tracks have design speeds that range from 40 to 100 kilometer per hour.5 Rail weights also differ. Those in South Korea range from 50 to 60 kilograms per meter while those in North Korea range from 37 to 50 kilograms per meter.Differences in stations also need to be addressed. South Korean railway tracks have platforms that are 500 mm in height and high-level platforms that are 1135 mm in height. North Korean railway tracks have platforms that are 300 mm in height and high-level platforms that are 1200 mm in height. The clearance of railway stations in South Korea is 6,450 mm. The clearance of railway stations in North Korea is 6,000 mm. In order to accommodate South Korean rail cars, North Korea's railways and stations need to extend their clearance by 450 mm. The current Annex to the Basic Agreement addresses the management of issues related to train length (Chapter 2, Article 9) and station clearance (Chapter 4, Article 26). However, it does not include much reference to other architectural and engineering differences between the tracks and gauges of North and South Korean railways.Railway Connections of the Korean PeninsulaThere are currently seven rail connections between North Korea and China, Russia, and South Korea.6 These connections and facilities vary considerably in size, capabilities, and operational status. For example, on the North Korea-China border, two connection points have large classification yards for assembling and reassembling freight trains. A third point has only a small yard.The four rail crossings between North Korea and China are:the Sino-Korean friendship bridge connecting the rail station, classification yard, and shops in Sinuiju, North Korea with those in Dandong, China;the Chongsu-Shanghekou railroad bridge connecting the rail facilities at Chongsu, North Korea with a rail station in Shanghekou, China;the Manpo-Jian railroad bridge connecting the rail station, classification yards, and shops at Manpo, North Korea with the Jian rail station in China; andthe Namyang-Tumen railroad bridge connecting the rail station, classification yard, and shops in Namyang, North Korea with those in Tumen, China.The single crossing between North Korea and Russia is:the North Korean and Russian rail networks meet at the Korean-Russian Friendship Bridge, which connects the rail station, classification yards, and shops at Tumangang, North Korea with those at Khasan, Russia.The two rail crossings between North and South Korea are:the Panmun-Dorasan railroad crossing connecting North Korea's Panmun (Kaesong) rail facility with South Korea's Dorasan rail station; andthe Kamho-Jejin railroad crossing from North Korea's Kamho (Nungho) rail facility to the Jejin rail station in South Korea.The North Korea-China Railroad Crossing at Sinuiju-Dandong\n\n             Located on the border with China in the northwest corner of North Korea's North Pyongan province, the Sinuiju-Dandong railroad crossing connects the North Korean city of Sinuiju to the Chinese city of Dandong. This crossing consists of the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge (42.949050 129.849236) a combination road and rail bridge across the Yalu River, the Dandong railyards, and the Sinuiju railyards. This is the most well-known and important rail crossing between China and North Korea as it serves as the primary railroad crossing for passenger and general freight between the two countries. This crossing is, therefore, a lead indicator of the level of economic activity between the two countries.\n\n             On the North Korean side of the border the Sinuiju railyards are significantly smaller by comparison encompassing only 0.12 square kilometers and consists of:a freight classification yard with approximately nine tracks;a locomotive and rail car repair and servicing shop;passenger car servicing facility; andcovered passenger and freight terminal with approximately four tracks.\n\n             A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that, like the Dandong railyards, the Sinuiju railyards are active year-round. However, due to the covered passenger and freight terminal, an accurate accounting of the average number of rail cars present is not practical. The large covered terminals at both Dandong and Sinuiju are the only ones located on the China-North Korea border and are useful in masking the number and types of rail cars (and to a certain extent their contents) moving between the two nations.\n\n             Befitting its importance, the rail line from Sinuiju to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang is one of the best maintained and the most modern in the North Korean railroad network.Taken as a whole, the Dandong railyards encompass approximately 0.44 square kilometers making them the second largest Chinese rail facility on the North Korean border - the largest rail facility is at Tumen, which encompasses 0.9 square kilometers. Among the more significant rail facilities located at Dandong are:freight classification and holding yards with approximately 25 tracks;a secondary holding yard with two tracks;locomotive and rail car repair and servicing shops (many of which are covered);extensive warehouse facilities (many of which are covered) and unloading docks;extensive rail side industrial facilities; andlarge covered passenger and freight terminal with approximately 16 tracks.\n\n             A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that the Dandong railyards are very active year-round, as is to be expected for the Chinese city situated on the primary border crossing with North Korea. They may also provide an evidentiary basis to the claim by experts that China has normalized commerce with North Korea after a period of harsh sanctioning in the last quarter of 2017. An accurate accounting of the average number of locomotives and rail cars present, however, is not practical due to a large number of extensive covered rail facilities (e.g., warehouse and terminals).\n\n             While they are known primarily in South Korea and the U.S. as being the focal point of cross border trade between China and North Korea and an overall indicator of China-North Korea relations, the railyards at Sinuiju and Dandong are primarily designed to serve their respective cities. Both of which have large populations and a variety of industries. In both cases the railyards serve as critical rail facilities in their regions with special capabilities (e.g., locomotive, rail car and passenger car repair and servicing facilities, etc.). For Sinuiju, the only comparable rail servicing facilities in North Pyongan province are found at Chonju, far to the south. While the facilities at Dandong are the largest and most comprehensive in eastern Liaoning province.Regardless of the political-economic conditions in play at any given time, the Sinuiju-Dandong railroad crossing and railyards serve as the primary interchange for trade between the two countries. For North Korea the crossing is critical to its economic and security well-being.The North Korea-China Railroad Crossing at Chongsu-Shanghekou\n\n             Located on the border with China in North Pyongan province, approximately 58 kilometers northeast of the Dandong-Sinuiju crossing, is the Chongsu-Shanghekou railroad crossing (40.458850 124.879464) over the Yalu River. This is a secondary crossing between the two countries that consists of the bridge that connects the small North Korean city of Chongsu to the Chinese town of Shanghekou, rail facilities at Chongsu, and a rail station at Shanghekou.\n\n             Approximately 950 meters east of the Chongsu-Shanghekou Rail Bridge is the Chongsu railyard (40.459327 124.890642) that encompass approximately 0.1 square kilometers. The railyard contains a small passenger station with four tracks - two of which are used for freight and coal sorting and storage. In the past there was sizeable locomotive servicing and repair facility here; however, this has been abandoned, and the track was removed prior to 2006. All that remains are the foundation of a turntable, roundhouse, thermal plant, and several support buildings. A refurbishing of these structures, therefore, would be a lead indicator of expanded cooperation in the future.\n\n             Located approximately 3.5 kilometers southwest of the bridge is the small rail station at Shanghekou (40.437281 124.850714). This is a minor facility encompassing approximately 0.01 square kilometers consisting of a passenger station with a mainline and passing track and no railyard or servicing facilities.\n\n             A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2017-2018 shows essentially no rail traffic at the Shanghekou rail station and only minor traffic in the Chongsu railyard. This suggests that there is no significant rail traffic at this crossing between the two countries at this time. The minor rail traffic seen at the Chongsu rail facility is likely in support of the city of Chongsu. Such traffic may increase if the reported construction of a nuclear-grade graphite production plant in the city proves to be correct.The Chongsu-Shanghekou railroad crossing is a secondary point of interchange between North Korea and China. The small rail station at Shanghekou and the declining facilities at Chongsu strongly suggest that they do not presently contribute significantly to either nations rail network economy. Due to this crossings remote location, it is likely that even if economic cooperation between China and North Korea increases this crossing will remain of secondary importance.The North Korea-China Railroad Crossing at Manpo-Jian\n\n             Located on the border with China, approximately 35 kilometers northwest of the Kanggye, is the Manpo-Jian railroad crossing (41.155090 126.273282) in Chagang province. This crossing consists of both the Manpo-Jian railroad bridge and, 1.2 kilometers to the northeast, the Manpo-Jian road bridge. Both bridges connect the small North Korean city of Manpo to the much larger Chinese city of Jian.\n\n             On the North Korean side of the border, the Manpo railyard is located 750 meters southeast of the rail bridge and encompasses 0.14 square kilometers - making it physically the largest North Korean rail facility on the Chinese border. The facility consists of:a freight classification yard with approximately four tracks;a passenger terminal with four tracks;two storage\/holding yards - one with four tracks (tank cars) and the other with six tracks (passenger and freight cars); andlarge locomotive and rail car repair and servicing shops consisting of a repair building, roundhouse, turntable, thermal plant, and several support buildings.\\n\n   A preliminary review of satellite imagery shows that the Manpo rail facility is relatively active year-round with approximately 90-125 locomotives and rail cars of various types present at any given time; however, a number of these in the holding yards appear to be in storage or retired in place as they haven't moved in years.\n\n              Located on the Chinese side of the border, 6.8 kilometers west of the railroad bridge, is the small Jian rail station. The station encompasses approximately 0.1 square kilometers and consists of:a passenger station and small freight classification yard with seven tracks; andseveral freight warehouses and unloading docks.The Jian rail station has no significant rail servicing or repair facilities.\n\n             A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that the Jian passenger station and small freight classification yard are active year-round, as is to be expected for a small Chinese city, with an average 10-25 locomotives and rail cars of various types present at any given time.\n\n             While considered a secondary crossing, the Manpo-Jian railroad crossing appears to be an important rail and road connection between China and the North Korean industrial cities of Kanggye and Pyorha-ri, and Chonchonall of which are involved in military-related production. Therefore, this connection, and the volume of traffic through it, could be considered a lead indicator of an upturn in China-North Korea commerce.The North Korea-China Railroad Crossing at Namyang-Tumen\n\n             Located on the border with China, in the furthest northeast corner of North Korea, is the Namyang-Tumen railroad crossing (42.949050 129.849236) in North Hamgyong province. This crossing consists of both the Tumen railroad bridge (Tumen-gyo) and, 600 meters to the northeast, the Tumen road bridge (Tumen-taegyo). Additionally, a new larger road bridge has been under construction since 2016. The bridges connect the small North Korean city of Namyang to the much larger Chinese city of Tumen.\n\n             On the North Korean side of the border, the Namyang railyard is both tiny and rudimentary by comparison encompassing only 0.12 square kilometers and consists of:a freight classification yard with approximately nine tracks;small rudimentary locomotive and rail car repair and servicing shop;one small coal storage yard;a passenger terminal; anda passenger car servicing facility.\n\n             A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that although small the Namyang rail facility is relatively active year-round with an average of 42 locomotives and rail cars of various types present. As with the Tumen rail facilities, over 90 percent of these are ore carrying cars.\n\n             Taken as a whole, the Tumen railyards encompass approximately 0.9 square kilometers making them the largest Chinese rail facility on the North Korean border. In comparison, the second largest rail facility is at Dandong and encompass only 0.4 square kilometers. Among the more significant rail facilities at Tumen are:7a freight classification yard with approximately 20 tracks;extensive locomotive and rail car repair and servicing shops;an intermodal yard (rail-to-truck);eight coal storage yards (two of which are for power generation);two passenger terminals;a passenger car servicing facility; andnumerous freight warehouses and unloading docks.\n\n             A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that the Tumen railyards are very active year-round as is to be expected for a Chinese city situated on an important border crossing with an average in excess of 500 locomotives and rail cars of various types present; however, over 90 percent are ore carrying cars.\n\n             The Tumen railyards are primarily designed to serve Tumen city and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in general. The railyards consist of a wide range of facilities (e.g., locomotive and rail car repair and servicing shops, passenger car repair and servicing facilities, intermodal yard, etc.) that compliment rather than supplant those found in nearby Yanbian, Hunchun and Wangqing. To a significantly lesser degree, and under favorable political-economic conditions, the Tumen railyards serve as an important railroad interchange for trade with North Korea.The proximity of the Namyang-Tumen crossing to the ore mines in North Hamgyong province and the presence of seven coal yards among the Tumen rail facilities are notable and suggest that this is one of the primary land routes for the export of coal from North Korea to China. Therefore, it is a lead indicator of the volume of bilateral business between the two in extractive industries. In addition, should overall economic cooperation between China and North Korea increase, it is logical that the Tumen railyards will be the primary port of entry for goods moving between the Rason Special Economic Zone (specifically the port of Rason [Najin] 88 kilometers to the south). Despite considerable Chinese investment in Rason in the past, a preliminary examination using satellite imagery of rail activity and shipping movements at the port during 2018 does not indicate any significant activity that would suggest significant Chinese use of the port.The construction of a new road bridge that began in 2016 is an additional indicator of the importance of the Namyang-Tumen railroad crossing to both countries.The North Korea-Russia Railroad Crossing at Tumangang-Khasan\n\n             Located on the border with Russia, in the northeast corner of the country on the Tumen River, is the Tumangang-Khasan railroad crossing (42.415397 130.641489), in North Hamgyong province. The crossing consists of the Korean-Russian Friendship Bridge, Tumangang railyard and Khasan railyard. This is North Koreas sole railroad crossing with Russia and is of great potential importance due to its proximity to the port city of Rason (Najin) in the Rason Special Economic Zone, 33.5 km to the southeast. Although a railroad bridge across the Tumen River has been at this location since the colonial days, the current Korean-Russian Friendship Bridge replaced that bridge in 1959.\n\n             The Tumangang railyard (42.417307 130.618461) encompasses approximately 2.5 square kilometers making it the nations largest rail facility connecting to any country. It serves as the gateway for all rail shipped goods between North Korea and Russia, but more importantly is the point where goods are transferred from Russian-gauged rail cars to Korean-gauged rail cars. Among the more significant rail facilities located here are:two large classification and storage yards with approximately 10 tracks and 8 tracks respectively;locomotive, rail, and passenger car repair and servicing shops;a passenger terminal;numerous freight warehouses, unloading docks, open-storage areas, and rail-side industries; anda dispersed, but sizable, petroleum products storage facility with approximately 33 storage tanks.8\n\n             A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that the Tumangang facilities are active year-round as is to be expected for a railyard situated on both the major rail line serving the northeast corner of the nation and an important border crossing. Approximately 45-80 locomotives and rail cars of various types are present at any given time. Of these, 40-50 percent are tank cars suggesting that the petroleum products storage facility is a major source of rail traffic. Therefore, this railway node is probably the most transparent lead indicator of Russian energy assistance to North Korea. It is unclear, however, how much of the rail traffic at the Tumangang railyard is related to trade with Russia.\n\n  Encompassing 1.2 square kilometers, the Khasan railyard (42.430654 130.645571) is physically the largest along any border with North Korea. Much of it, however, is either open land or abandoned. About the only facilities currently operational here are:a freight classification yard with approximately nine tracks;a passenger terminal; andsome small support buildings.\n\n             A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that the Khasan rail facility is active year-round, however, there are wide swings in the number of locomotives and rail cars of various types present. These swings can vary from just 2 to over 200. When larger numbers are present over 95 percent are ore (most likely coal) carrying cars.\n\n             The proximity of the Tumangang rail facility to the large coal mines in North Hamgyong province and the presence of large numbers of coal cars in the Khasan rail facility are notable and indicate that this activity is related to the Russian importing of coal from North Korea. Should economic cooperation between Russia and North Korea increase, it is logical that this trade will increase, and the Tumangang rail facility will expand into the primary port of entry for goods moving between the two countries. Russian goods could eventually be exported from the Rason Special Economic Zone (specifically the port of Rason [Najin]) and, if the rail connections are made, to the South Korean ports of Pohang and Busan.The North Korea-South Korea Railroad Crossing at Panmun-Dorasan and Kamho-JejinSee Part 1 of CSIS Survey Study for South Korea crossings.References and NotesThe authors wish to thank Sea Young (Sarah) Kim of the Georgetown University MA in Asian Studies program and the CSIS Korea Chair for her invaluable research in support of this project.Specifically, the Panmunjom Declaration states, the two Koreas will adopt practical steps towards the connection and modernization of the railways and roads on the eastern transportation corridor as well as between Seoul and Sinuiju for their utilization. This commitment to the inter-Korean railway project was reaffirmed by the Pyongyang Joint Declaration, signed after the third inter-Korean summit in 2018 on September 18-20. In this declaration the two Koreas further agreed to hold a ground-breaking ceremony within the year for the connection of railways and roads along the east and west coasts.Suk Hi Kim, The Strategic Role of North Korea in Northeast Asia, in Suk Hi Kim, Terence Roehrig and Bernhard Seliger (eds.), The Survival of North Korea: Essays on Strategy, Economics and International Relations (Jefferson, NC: 2011), 72.Korea Rail Network Authority, Research on Integrated Rail Network Project: Final Report (Daejeon: 2010), 57.According to the Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS), North Koreas railway track was estimated to be 5,302 km as of 2014, which is around 1.5 times more than the 3,590 km track of South Korea. Around 80 percent of North Korean tracks are underground while around 68 percent of South Korean tracks are underground. If accounting for the double-tracks of South Korean railways, however, South Korea has more railway tracks (8,465 km) since the majority of North Korean railways are single-tracks. Many of the existing North Korean railway tracks were also inherited from the Japanese colonial era, and railway technology has largely remained stagnant for over two decades.

{"title":"The Ice Curtain: Tiksi Airbase; Many Russian Announcements, Little Equipment","body":null,"content":"The IssueFortified air defense units along the Russian Arctic coast were staples of the Soviet Union's national defense strategy for the Arctic. The coastal defense units at Tiksi (Yakutia, Sakha Republic) played an important role in securing Arctic air space and fortifying Russia's northern coast. Geographically, Tiksi is approximately 2,600 kilometers from United States (Alaska).\n            \n                \n                    \n                \n                \n             Source: Google MapsThe Russian government has repeatedly announced ambitious plans to expand Tiksi Airbase to include 11 new structures consisting of a dormitory and administrative buildings, a diesel-run power station, and water and fuel reservoirs. The base was designated to receive and operate a regiment of sophisticated S-400 surface-to-air missiles to enhance air defense, which could later be supplemented by radiotechnical regiments that monitor the defended airspace.1 However, current satellite imagery does not show evidence of the S-400 system or the considerable expansion. Russia appears to be significantly behind in its plans for Tiksi, or unable to send permanent equipment as other Arctic bases are of higher priority.Tiksi's completed development would represent a fusing of Russia's military needs and its ambitious economic plans, specifically as it relates to new construction on Tiksi Airbase and anticipated additional infrastructure. These dual-use features combine Russian military presence for territorial defense and power projection with capabilities designed to also address civilian security needs such as search-and-rescue, oil spill response and maritime domain awareness in anticipation of increasing commercial shipping through the Northern Sea Route (NSR). Dual-use aspects of Russia's military and infrastructure is increasingly a standard feature if its Arctic presence along the NSR. However, delays and incomplete outposts may suggest financial limitations are restricting to Russia's Arctic ambitions.BackgroundSince World War II, there have been at least three Russian air facilities on Tiksi Tiksi North Airbase (abandoned, 72.038300 128.471993), Tiksi West Airbase (abandoned, 71.693779 128.680116) and the current joint-use Tiksi Airbase and Airport (71.702462 128.895752). During the Cold War, Tiksi Airbase maintained an air detachment from the 37thAir Army of the Supreme High Command, in addition to long-range strategic bombers as well as intelligence collection, communications, and early warning units in the surrounding area. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, many Arctic military facilities were either abandoned, ceded to local government, or deteriorated due to a lack of maintenance and change of defense priorities. In the case of Tiksi Airbase, a detachment of Tu-95MS strategic missile carrying bombers (NATO refers to the TU-95 as the Bear Bomber) was withdrawn and replaced by a separate combined air squadron that included An-26 transport aircraft (NATO reporting name Curl), and helicopters for search-and-rescue operations.2 But by September 2012, even this air detachment was withdrawn from Tiksi due to significant runway deterioration. The airbase subsequently closed in October 2012 for runway repairs.3Satellite Imagery of Tiksi Facilities Do Not Match Official Russian AnnouncementsOn May 6, Secretary of State Pompeo stated that, \"Russia has been able to renovate old bases and infrastructure. It claims to have built 475 new military sites, including bases north of the Arctic Circle, as well as 16 new deep-water ports. It secures this presence through sophisticated new air defense systems and anti-ship missiles.\" However, the limited developments and minimal military equipment on Tiksi suggest it may not be a key outpost for Russia's enhanced presence, and instead, merely an aspirational project.Critical to Russia's ability to assert air dominance in the Arctic is the refurbishment and construction of airbases capable of hosting civilian and military aircraft. The planned refurbishment of Tiksi Airbase began in 2013 and was to include development of new military facilities and the deployment of new units in the area. Progress has been very slow to non-existent, and original construction focused solely on runway repairs, allowing the airbase to host a multitude of aircraft. This includes the permanent basing of transport and search-and-rescue helicopters, as well as the periodic deployment of interceptor and transport aircraft, Tu-95MS and Tu-160M (NATO reporting name Blackjack) long-range strategic missile-carrying aircraft, and Il-78 refueling aircraft at the airbase.4\n\n             Tiksi Airbase\/Airport (July 12, 2013)\n\n             Tiksi Airbase\/Airport (September 2, 2018)\n\n             Tiksi Airbase\/Airport (March 2, 2019)By 2014 the Tiksi runway was complete and the base was used by airborne troops for field exercises. A unit of Mi-26 heavy transport helicopters (NATO reporting name Halo) was deployed from the Uprun Airbase, Chelyabinsk, to form a mixed aviation unit with Mi-8\/-17 helicopters (NATO reporting name Hip). These helicopters subsequently supported the construction of the new arctic base on Kotelny. 5 During 2015 it was reported that a S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile (NATO reporting name SA-21 Growler) regiment had been deployed in the Tiksi area.6 The following year, in July 2016, it was announced that Tiksi Airbase would become a permanent base for high-altitude MiG-31 (NATO reporting name Foxhound) interceptors.7In August 2018, Northern Fleet commander Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov announced that a new air [defense] division was established, and troops would deploy to the Novaya Zemlya archipelago and the Arctic towns of Dikson and Tiksi. Their mission, according to Yevmenov, was to ensure the safety of airspace over the NSR.8 Five months later, it was reported that the Northern Fleets new air defense base at Tiksi was 95 percent complete and that it would consist of 11 interconnected structures including a dormitory, administrative building, a diesel-run power station, water and fuel reservoirs, cantina, garages and more. Reportedly, this base would operate a regiment S-400 surface-to-air missiles and would later be supplemented by radiotechnical regiments that monitor the defended airspace.9Despite the many announcements, these military systems do not appear in the satellite images analyzed. While this does not rule out the possibility that they will be stationed on Tiksi in the future, it is important to note that Russian statements about Tiksi may be overblown and designed to deter foreign nations from the region. In fact, satellite images acquired between 2013 and 2019 show very little construction. The primary features of the Tiksi area are the town, the port of Tiksi, and the Tiksi Airbase, located 6.5 kilometers to the north. Scattered throughout the area are numerous small fuel storage and communications facilities, including an unusually high number of COMINT and SIGINT facilities, such as an old KRUG II CDAA (direction finding) installation (71.660426 128.676842) which would likely be used to detect or monitor U.S. or NATO assets. It is unclear from satellite imagery alone how many of these facilities are currently active.\n\n             Tiksi, Russia (July 12, 2013)\n\n             Tiksi, Russia (September 2, 2018)\n\n             Tiksi, Russia (March 2, 2019)While minor construction took place, the physical structure and size of the town and port of Tiksi did not change significantly during this time period.\n\n             Tiksi, Russia (July 12, 2013)\n\n             Tiksi, Russia (September 2, 2018)\n\n             Tiksi, Russia (March 2, 2019)Tiksi Airbase consists of a single runway that measures 3,100-meters-by-60-meters, a single taxiway, civilian airport facilities, and military airbase facilities both showing only rudimentary maintenance and servicing capabilities. Additionally, no military aircraft hangars are present, meaning in extreme climatic conditions maintenance and servicing activities could not be conducted in the open.\n\n             Tiksi Airbase\/Airport (September 2, 2018)Despite the occasional reports discussing their deployment, none of the satellite images examined show the presence of Tu-95MS, Tu-160, or similar long-range strategic missile-carrying bombers. Similarly, although it was announced during 2016 that Tiksi would become a permanent base for high-altitude MiG-31 interceptors, satellite imagery provides no evidence of their or any other fighter\/interceptor aircraft presence at the base. The lack of hangars or extensive maintenance and servicing facilities strongly suggest that it is unlikely that any of these aircraft could be deployed to Tiksi except for temporary or emergency duty for short durations.Only five of the images of Tiksi Airbase show passenger, transport, or support aircraft. The largest number of these aircraft were observed in an image from July 12, 2013, when an An-22 strategic heavy lift transport (NATO reporting name Cock), three Il-18D transports (NATO reporting name Coot), four Mi-8\/-17 helicopters and a single Mi-6 helicopter (NATO reporting name Hook) were present.10 Subsequent images show a mixed squadron of five-eight Mi-8\/-17 and Mi-26 helicopters which provide transport, search-and-rescue, and antisubmarine warfare (ASW) capabilities.\n\n             Tiksi Airbase\/Airport (July 12, 2013)\n\n             Tiksi Airbase\/Airport (March 2, 2019) - revised\n\n             Tiksi Airbase\/Airport (July 12, 2013) - revised\n\n             Tiksi Airbase\/Airport (September 2, 2018)\n\n             Tiksi Airbase\/Airport (March 2, 2019)\n\n             Tiksi Airbase\/Airport (July 12, 2013)\n\n             Tiksi Airbase\/Airport (July 12, 2013)\n\n             Tiksi Airbase\/Airport (September 2, 2018)\n\n             Tiksi Airbase\/Airport (March 2, 2019)The 2015 reports of the deployment of a S-400 surface-to-air missile unit to Tiksi are not confirmed by available satellite imagery. If deployment did occur, it was likely a temporary deployment potentially for Arctic field trials. Late-2018 and early-2019 reports described the construction of a small installation of eleven buildings for an S-400 regiment in the Tiksi area. To date, neither the installation nor S-400 missile systems have been definitively identified in the satellite images examined. In sum, and based on available imagery, much of Russia's plans to bolster and equip Tiksi remain aspirational.The Proliferation and Importance of Dual-Use Outposts across the Russian ArcticIt appears that dual-use outposts across the Arctic are the defining characteristic of Russia's military footprint in the region. In 2009, Russia allocated 910 million rubles (approximately 27.1 million) to construct 10 dual-use search-and-rescue centers spanning the NSR with refurbished airfields, ports, and advanced communication systems. Although, only a handful are complete, the infrastructure enhances capabilities that are critical to defending Russia's Arctic territory and securing the NSR.Radio-Electronic DefensePerhaps Russias greatest priority for Tiksi is in its communication and satellite systems. Tiksi is reportedly part of a network of airbases and surveillance satellite installations on remote islands running as far east at Wrangel Island 300 miles from the Alaskan coast. These satellites serve military purposes (supplementing Russia's early warning radar network, intelligence gathering, and antisubmarine warfare [ASW]) as well as civilian purposes (search-and-rescue, maritime domain awareness, and communications). As a network, these satellites and radars create what the Russians describe as a \"protective dome\" to defend and secure Russia's Arctic airspace. These capabilities are complimented by air assets -- such as the mixed squadron observed on Tiksi, or the potential future deployment (if these plans are realized) of long-range strategic missile-carrying bombers, and basing of high-altitude MiG-31 interceptors, or S-400 surface-to-air missiles. The completion of this network would allow Russia to assert its total control over the NSR, and deters outside threats from air, land, and sea.On Tiksi, the presence of COMINT and SIGINT facilities, such as the KRUG II CDAA, are for radio direction finding, intelligence monitoring, and search-and-rescue operations. Its potential reach spans an area stretching several thousand nautical miles off Russia's Arctic coast.If these facilities are active, Russia enhances monitoring of both surface vessel and air activity, and controls the operating space surrounding the NSR. Intelligence collected by the facility would likely be communicated to the Northern Fleet, prompting a quick response to either a civilian incident or military advance by a foreign nation.\n\n             KRUG II CDAA installation; Tiksi, Russia (July 12, 2013)\n\n             KRUG II CDAA; Tiksi, Russia (March 2, 2019)The Northern Fleet, and its newly created Center for Radio-Electronic Warfare, is creating a \"radio-electronic shield\" across the NSR. The network of systems is designed for radio-electronic warfare and includes the Murmansk-BN, Krasukha-2, and Krasukha-4 that can jam satellite communications, GPS signals, and drone communication. The systems are currently deployed to key outposts and coastal settlements including in the Kola Peninsula, Novaya Zemlya, Severnaya Zemlya, and the New Siberian Islands. The development of these new systems follows reports that civilian aircrafts in Scandinavia often lose GPS signals when flying in the high north. GPS jamming was a major talking point earlier this year when Norwegian officials met with a Russian defense delegation to discuss bilateral relations.Tiksi PortTiksi's port facilities are also of interest to the Kremlin. The port and its proximity to the Lena River could serve as a hub for increased movement of goods from the Arctic to mainland Siberia. In 2017 the Russian government budgeted five billion rubles (78 million) for the reconstruction of the port and other infrastructure projects. The port currently handles an estimated 67,000 tons of goods with the hope of eventually handling 300,000 tons. Updated port facilities could also support an increase in shipping traffic along the NSR but it is unlikely that these ports would have deep enough drafts to manage commercial container vessels.Port facilities are also a focal point for Russia's integration of military and civilian assets. This could be viewed as both a cost saving measure and an effort by the Kremlin to enhance its surface and sub-surface capabilities. Ports associated with these dual-use outposts like Tiksi, Dikson, Dudinka, and Pevek, would expand Russia's naval reach into an increasingly accessible Arctic Ocean. Russia's powerful Northern Fleet used Tiksi Bay in 2018, conducting its first ever warship training, which included a coordinated naval attack on an unequipped coast. As dual-use outpost continue to come online across the NSR, similar exercises blurring the line between military and civilian activity could occur with greater frequency.ConclusionClearly, all that is announced by the Kremlin when it comes to it military posture in the Arctic is not necessarily true. This is especially true regarding Tiksi Airbase today. It appears that Tiksi's value may be its part in a growing radio electronic warfare element. It is also important to continue to monitor the development of such dual-use network of outposts as Tiksi spanning the NSR as far west as Pechenga and Severomorsk in the Barents Sea, and as far east as Providenya and Anadyr-Ugolny along the Bering Strait. Collectively, these outposts enhance Russia's forward operating presence and flexible response where it can monitor surface and air domains or respond quickly with power project assets across the Arctic region. It will be important to watch the use and integration of these dual-use outposts prior to (e.g., snap exercises) and during the Tsentsr-2019 exercise, Russia's next large-scale exercise involving the Central Military District scheduled for September. This will help us better understand how they could operationally fit into Russia's Arctic military strategy.References and NotesIn Russian usage Radiotechnical typically refers to radar, intelligence collection and support assets.

{"title":"The Ice Curtain: Protecting the Arctic Motherland","body":null,"content":"The IssueRussian military officials recently invited international journalists to tour the newly refurbished Arctic Temp airbase on Kotelny Island, one of the largest of the New Siberian Islands, situated off the northern Siberian coast. In the past, Russian bases were closed to outside observers, but the Russian government appears eager to show the international community its modern air defense infrastructure and capabilities prior to Russia's annual International Arctic Forum. In addition to Temp airbase, Kotelny is equipped with a state-of-the-art trefoil military compound; communications and Sopka-2 radar facilities; and pads for radar, command and control, and missile launch vehicles. Kotelny is a central element in Russia's growing network of Arctic islands that create a protective dome around its coastline and includes key outposts, such as Wrangel Island. Along with active Russian sub-surface vessels, new anti-air and anti-ship capabilities on Kotelny represent a robust anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) bubble in the Arctic, which could limit NATO and U.S. air and maritime capabilities in the region.IntroductionDuring the Cold War, Moscow maintained a military observation post and radar station on Kotelny but it, along with other derelict Arctic outposts, was largely abandoned after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. But in 2013, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that it was redeveloping Kotelny Island as part of a larger effort to reestablish a regular naval presence in the Arctic. Increased maritime patrols would safeguard Russia's territorial waters and extensive Arctic coastline, protect mineral and energy resources, and monitor shipping along the Northern Sea Route. Principal among these naval assets its Northern Fleet, the Kremlin's most visible and powerful fleet in the Arctic which includes its sea-based nuclear deterrent and sub-surface vessels that now frequently patrol the region and the North Atlantic.The Kremlin has also enhanced its naval aviation assets in the region and is actively exercising its new Arctic capabilities, flying over 100 Arctic sorties in 2018 of reconnaissance, maritime patrol, and anti-submarine aircraft. The Northern Fleets air and air defense units engaged in 2,700 firing exercises including 51 missile launches in 2017, and 148 exercises in 2018 accompanied by 157 rocket launches. These exercises increasingly rehearse Russia's complex and combined operations while testing its ability to mobilize rapidly to defend its Arctic coastline. It is for these reasons that Russia's growing suite of integrated air and missile defense assets in the Arctic, to include the deployment of Bastion-P coastal defense system equipped with supersonic P-800 Oniks\/Yakhont anti-ship cruise missiles, must be assessed for its defense implications to the U.S. and NATO.The 15 satellite images examined between 2013-2019, show a concerted program was undertaken since 2014 to construct at least eight and potentially as many as eleven specialized weapons pads along the Kotelny coastline and at Temp Airbase. These weapons pads are used by radar, command and control, and missile launch vehicles and are uniquely pyramidal in shape, elevated above the tundra for drainage and stability. These pads vary in size and are now being used to support the Bastion-P coastal defense missile system and other air and coastal defense missile systems. Only those satellite images dating from September 2018 show direct evidence of the deployment of the Bastion-P on Kotelny Island, which corroborates Russian reporting of the systems delivery to the island at that time. This construction effort clearly indicates a logical and well-planned Russian project over the past five years to develop air and maritime defenses of an important Arctic island base.\n\n             Russian military facilities on Kotelny Island with the pads for radar, command and control and missile launch vehicles highlighted, August 7, 2018 (Courtesy European Space Agency).Why the Kotelny Bastion-P Deployment is ImportantA major upgrade to Russian Arctic coastal defense capabilities (on Kotelny and by extension the Northern Fleet) occurred during 2018 when at least a battery-sized unit of K-300P Bastion-P (NATO reporting name SS-C-5 Stooge) coastal defense missiles were deployed to Kotelny by sea.1 The Bastion-P system is a modern coastal defense missile system that employs the supersonic P-800 Oniks\/Yakhont (NATO reporting name SS-N-26 Strobile) anti-ship cruise missile. The P-800 has a maximum range of 300 km and is significantly more modern and more capable than the older 4K51 Rubezh system (NATO reporting name SSC-3 Styx), a longer-range dedicated coastal defense cruise missile system.2\n\n             The two large weapons pads constructed at Temp Airbase during 2017 as seen on September 25, 2018, the day before the live firing exercise.\n\n             The large unoccupied weapons pad midpoint along the runway of Temp Airbase during 2017, the day prior to the live firing exercise, September 25, 2018.\n\n             The large weapons pad at the southwest end of Temp Airbase showing two Bastion-P TELs and a command and control vehicle the day before the live firing exercise, September 25, 2018.Two Bastion-P TELs subsequently took part in a live-firing exercise on September 26, 2018 as part of the larger Vostok-2018, considered the largest Russian military exercise since the end of the Cold War.3 It was also the first known live-fire test of the system by the Northern Fleet, which mobilized across the Northern Sea Route to participate in the exercises in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. Commander of the Northern Fleet, Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov stated that \"the crew of the Bastion coastal missile system successfully carried out missile firing at a naval target position [in the Laptev Sea] at a range of over 60 kilometers to prove its readiness to effectively fulfill combat duty in the Arctic and protect the island area and the sea coast of Russia.\"4 Both satellite imagery and ground footage released by the Russian Ministry of Defense show that the Bastion-P launchers and a command and control vehicle were positioned on the weapons pad at the southwest end of Temp Airbase for the exercise.\n\n             A view looking northeast at the two Bastion-P TELs deployed on the large weapons pad at Temp Airbase for a live-firing exercise.

While its range is limited and its location on Kotelny Island poses no immediate threat to U.S. or neighboring countries, the Bastion-P system projects Russian sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction over the Northern Sea Route (NSR) at a time when the Kremlin is actively seeking international investment to develop the route. The positioning of more robust capabilities could also be in anticipation of a future Russian assertion of jurisdiction over its proposed extended outer continental shelf claims, which are currently under review by the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. Moreover, these enhanced capabilities support Russia's assertion that the NSR is an internal, rather than an international passage. A January statement from U.S. Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer that the U.S. Navy will consider a freedom of navigation operation (FONOP) in the Arctic could be viewed by the Kremlin as justification for a military response. In an ominous and possibly foreshadowing comment, President Putin recently stated that he \"wouldn't like to see the Arctic turning into something like Crimea...due to our failure to take timely measures.\"The Making of KotelnyDuring the first two weeks of September 2013, a Russian Navy flotilla offloaded personnel, heavy engineering equipment and material to begin construction of the new base on Kotelny. Aside from housing and support facilities, contemporaneous reports state that among the facilities to be constructed were an air command unit, medical center, satellite communications facility, naval dock, and a 2,500 meter airfield (then scheduled to be completed by the end of October) subsequently identified as the Temp Airbase.5 All of this was reported to be under the control of the Northern Fleets newly established 99th Arctic Tactical Group.6\n\n             The administration and housing trefoil on Kotelny Island, March 15, 2019.\n\n             A March 15, 2019 overview of the Kotelny communications facility, Sopka-2 radar installation and the twin weapons pads.\n\n             A closeup view of the communications facility, Sopka-2 radar installation, March 15, 2019.The first mention of any air or coastal defense missile systems deployed to Kotelny occurred during the Vostok-2014 exercise when Russian media announced that a Pantsir-S1 coastal missile system [based on Kotelny] opened fire [and] successfully hit a Termit air cruise missile target and proved their readiness to protect Russia's northern borders.7 The Pantsir-S1 (NATO reporting name SA-22 Greyhound) is a short-range point defense system capable of engaging aircraft, UAVs and cruise missiles. Subsequent reports indicate that a battalion level unit equipped with the system was assigned to the 99th Arctic Tactical Group.8 Satellite imagery from 2013-2014, shows that none of the unique pyramidal weapons pads for the system had yet been constructed.Within a year the Pantsir-S1 on Kotelny was augmented by a unit equipped with the SSC-3 Styx coastal defense missile system.9 Satellite imagery shows that the first of the unique weapons pads, the twin complex 1.8 kilometers southwest of the housing and administration trefoil, was constructed during September 2015. It is likely that it was from here that both Pantsir-S1 and the older SSC-3 Styx systems participated in a live firing exercise later that month.10\n\n             A closeup view of the twin weapons pads as seen on March 15, 2019. These were the first of the unique pyramidal weapons pads constructed on Kotelny Island.During September-December 2015 three additional weapons pads were built in an area three kilometers northwest of the housing and administration trefoil. This was followed by the early 2016 construction of a conjoined weapons pad 4.7 kilometers northwest of the housing and administration trefoil. Construction of two large weapons pads on Temp Airbase subsequently took place during mid-2017. Concurrently three additional weapons pads were constructed further inland, in a rectangular-shaped pattern, approximately 3.7 kilometers north of the housing and administration trefoil.11\n\n             The three weapons pads constructed during late-2015 three kilometers northwest of the administration and housing trefoil, March 15, 2019. A fourth pad that was built during 2017 is seen at the left of the image.\n\n             Closeup view of the conjoined weapons pads, March 8, 2018.Again, both the Pantsir-S1 and SSC-3 Styx systems participated in live-fire exercises during 2016 and 2017.12 These firing exercises were conducted from the new weapons pads along the coast and at Temp Airbase. Satellite imagery from August 31, 2017 supports this assessment as three Pantsir-S1 transporter-erector-launchers (TEL) were observed at the northernmost weapons pad.\n\n             A view through clouds at three Pantsir-S1 TELs and a command post vehicle on the conjoined weapons pad on August 31, 2017.Weapons pads on Kotelny (as of March 2019)\n\n             A Growing and More Effective Russian Military Presence in the ArcticDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union viewed the Arctic as essential to its survivability: protection of its sub-surface strategic nuclear deterrent preserved second-strike capability while also deterring an attack. Twenty-eight years later, Russia's military presence on Kotelny Island demonstrates a complex layered coastal defense arrangement which include Temp Airbase, the Sopka-2 radar system, and the Bastion-P and Pantsir-S1 coastal defense systems. Temp Airbase is not a minor installation; its length and size mean its capable of accommodating large cargo planes such as Il-76 for significant reinforcement. The Sopka-2 radar is part of a larger network covering the entirety of Russia's northern border with penetration capabilities deeper into the central Arctic as seen on Russia's most easterly facing Arctic island, Wrangel Island. As a cuing radar, the Sopka-2 collects data and intelligence to detect activity emanating toward the north. That data could be used to improve Russian domain awareness or direct surface-to-air missiles or guns to engage aircraft or cruise missiles. The addition of the Pantsir-S1 coastal defense system and the accompanying weapons pads reinforce Russia's intent to defend its Arctic territory against foreign aircraft, UAVs, or cruise missiles, along with anti-ship systems (SSC-3 Styx and Bastion-P). Significant Russian improvements in its Arctic air and coastal defense over the past several years underscore its view of the Arctic as a tactical war-fighting domain. In addition to the regions role in Russia's broader nuclear deterrent strategy, the Arctic is now a region to defend and to deny aerial, maritime, or land access to NATO or U.S. forces. Russia's efforts to secure its Arctic territory and coastline through improved air defense capabilities are vital stepping stones to minimize its perceived defense vulnerabilities in the North.References and NotesNikolai Novichkov, Russian Navy fires Bastion in the Arctic, Janes 360, September 27, 2018, https:\/\/www.janes.com\/article\/83391\/russian-navy-fires-bastion-in-the-arctic; Northern Fleet to use Bastion coastal missile system at the Arctic exercise for the first time,Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, September 26, 2018, http:\/\/eng.mil.ru\/en\/news_page\/country\/more.htm?id=12196944@egNews; Aatle Staalesen, Russia shows off new missile shooting in high Arctic, The Barents Observer, September 26, 2018, https:\/\/thebarentsobserver.com\/en\/security\/2018\/09\/russia-shows-new-missile-shooting-high-arctic; and Russia Deploys Coastal Missiles in Arctic Drills, Moscow Times, September 25, 2018, https:\/\/themoscowtimes.com\/news\/russia-deploys-coastal-missiles-arctic-drills-62987.Ibid.; and \"Bastion-P,\"Military Today, accessed March 5, 2019, http:\/\/www.military-today.com\/missiles\/bastion_p.htm.Ibid.Northern Fleet to use Bastion coastal missile system at the Arctic exercise for the first time, Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, September 26, 2018, http:\/\/eng.mil.ru\/en\/news_page\/country\/more.htm?id=12196944@egNews.Common alternative spellings for the airbase are include: Tempe or Tempa.

{"title":"China's BRI in Nigeria: Spillover Effects of Lagos-Ibadan Railway to the Regional Economy - Part 1","body":null,"content":"IntroductionUnveiled by China in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is currently the world's most ambitious economic development program. Rooted in Beijing's desire to become a leader in global development, BRI aspires to promote economic development through infrastructure investment in over 68 countries whose economies constitute a combined 40 percent of global GDP. The program has invested an estimated $200 billion in partner countries globally, raising hopes that infrastructure mega-projects, such as railway investments, will stimulate economic growth in the developing world.1In a number of countries, this has been the case. In Ethiopia, for example, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) serves as Beijing's flagship BRI project, successfully linking land-locked Ethiopia to Djibouti's seaports and global maritime shipping lanes. Through the project, the Ethiopian government connected existing fragmented industrial bases, such as dry ports and industrial parks, creating a connected infrastructure to encourage economic growth in Ethiopia. While the project has indeed brought about modest positive impacts on the Ethiopian economy, the economic outcome is not as successful as anticipated, drawing into question the validity of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway as a model for African infrastructure development.In Nigeria, a new high-capacity, standard-gauge rail line is scheduled to begin operation in May 2019, linking Lagos, Nigeria's largest city, to the inland city of Ibadan, a non-oil industrial hub. The Lagos-Ibadan Railway shares several key characteristics and policy goals with the Addis Ababa-Djibouti line in East Africa; the Nigerian government plans to streamline the logistics by connecting the railway to major industrial cities and hence encourages export from different industries. However, unlike the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, the Lagos-Ibadan Railway is poorly connected with existing inland industrial bases, raising concerns over logistics efficiency and, ultimately, the potential for the Lagos-Ibadan Railway to replicate the modest economic gains attributed to the Addis Ababa-Djibouti line. Our research shows Nigeria will need additional infrastructure\/logistical capacity before the BRI investment can contribute to the economic development of the Nigerian economy.2Given the unprecedented scope of BRI and its potential geopolitical ramifications, the Chinese economic development model has attracted both enthusiastic fans and strident critics. However, while volumes are being written about the initiative, much of the conversation is based on opinion and subjective analysis. In the absence of cohesive data about financing terms, project details, and economic development outcomes of BRI projects, fact-based approaches to evaluating the BRI are badly needed.MethodologyTo this end, satellite imagery provides unique insights and objective evidence of BRI projects unfolding on the ground in real time. As the Lagos-Ibadan SGR approaches completion in May 2019, satellite imagery analysis is a critical tool in examining and projecting the railway's developmental impacts. Imagery analysis is in turn supported by additional sources, such as project documents, macroeconomic data, expert interviews, and other traditional research tools. In this way, we aim to gain new insights into BRI projects and the future value of similar assets that have cost billions of dollars to construct.Current State of Nigerian Railway NetworkRailways have played a critical role in economic development since the 19th century, transporting not only passengers but also high-value goods and services.3 Nigeria's existing narrow-gauge railway network, inherited from the British colonial period, is outdated and insufficient to handle modern freight and passenger volume. Moreover, the Nigerian government has not adequately maintained the existing rail system. The deteriorating railway has decreased transportation efficiency, resulting in increased transport costs and travel delays, contributing to hindered economic growth.The Lagos-Ibadan line is a significant step in the Nigerian government's goal of a modernized rail network. In 2012, the Nigerian government signed a construction contract for the railway with China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC), a Chinese state-owned enterprise. China Export-Import (EXIM) Bank financed the $1.53 billion project cost under concessional loan terms. The new standard-gauge Lagos-Ibadan line was designed to improve logistical efficiency, increase capacity to transport passengers and freight and generate comprehensive benefits for local economies along the railway.However, the rail project has already encountered challenges. Weather and equipment delivery delays have pushed back the railway's completion date from the original target in December 2018 to May 2019. In July 2018, construction of the Abeokuta station, an important hub between the Lagos and Ibadan, was suddenly relocated from its planned location at Trade Fair Complex to Oba New City, a six-kilometer distance apart after problematic engineering conditions were discovered. While construction delays are commonplace in complex projects, managerial complexities and construction quality play a key role in operational efficiency throughout the lifespan of a railway project.Examination of Benchmark Case in EthiopiaTo assess the impacts of the standard-gauge Lagos-Ibadan line, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti SGR serves as a helpful benchmark. Also constructed by the CCECC, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti line has been completed and operated since January 2018. The relatively new railway project has not yet fulfilled its role as a central part of the Ethiopian economy, as Ethiopian authorities are constructing connections between existing production facilities outside of the 759 km Addis Ababa-Djibouti line to the railway, including two dry ports and five fully operational industrial parks.4-5 The Addis Ababa-Djibouti line serves as a baseline for both the potential and the pitfalls facing the Lagos-Ibadan line in Nigeria.In Ethiopia, increased industrial and transport capacity has sprung up in the vicinity of railway stations. For example, an industrial park in the Ethiopian city of Adama was inaugurated in October 2018, shortly after construction of the Adama Railway Station.6 Imagery analysis confirms the expansion of the Adama Industrial Park following the completion of the nearby railway station. The park now houses two Chinese manufacturing firms and is nearing its projected goal of 25,000 local new jobs. In the city of Modjo, synergies between new railway connectivity and existing facilities are also evident, as the dry port adjacent to the new railway station already handles 74% of Ethiopia's import\/export and is under expansion to increase its export capacity.7 In the city of Awasa, since its inception in 2017, the inland Hawassa Industrial Park, the largest industrial park in Ethiopia, has already generated more than $38 million in revenue between January 2017 and December 2018. Textile companies in the park have created 23,000 jobs for local Ethiopians.8 However, freight transport remains extremely expensive: roughly $2,000 per container between Hawassa and the Djibouti port, which qualifies the optimism about Ethiopia's economic development.9 To address high transportation costs, the Ethiopian government began construction of an expressway connecting Hawassa Industrial Park to Modjo dry port, a project intended to streamline transport efficiency and simplify import and export processes. As illustrated by the Hawassa Industrial Park case, it is clear that rail infrastructure alone cannot support economic development without a coordinated plan connecting the railway to dry ports, industrial parks, and other critical infrastructure.\n\n The opening of the Adama Industrial Park after the construction of the new Adama railway station.\n\n             Active Mojdo dry port had been expanded further with the opening of a new Modjo railway station.\n\n             Fully completed Hawassa Industrial Park. Connected to an expressway that runs to the city of Modjo.The Nigerian CaseThe Addis Ababa-Djibouti case suggests that the potential of the Lagos-Ibadan SGR to support economic development will depend on the quality of its integration with regional industrial facilities. However, the manufacturing build-outs spotted in Ethiopia, and the jobs they have created are not yet visible along the Lagos-Ibadan SGR. Ambitions for dual passenger and freight have not been accompanied by connections to critical industrial assets along the Lagos-Ibadan line. Several key manufacturing plants including a British-American Tobacco processing facility, a Nestle production plant, and Dangote Cement facility as well as the Ogun-Guangdong Special Economic Zone (SEZ) are within a few dozen miles of the Lagos-Ibadan line. However, no plans have been announced to connect these facilities to the rail line, casting doubt on whether proximity to the railway will enable efficiency gains for the firms in question.Attempts to identify instances of significant spillover activity that can be attributed to the construction of the Lagos-Ibadan line yielded few results. For example, while the expansion of a railyard in Laguna Station in Abeokuta is evident from imagery analysis, activity beyond the railyard is limited to scattered residential and commercial developments. Examination of the railway's path along the Lagos-Ibadan corridor reveals little development that is comparable to Ethiopia's Adama Industrial Park, or similar industrial assets.\n\n             Fully completed Laguna railyard near Abeokuta displays a few residential developments along with the railway station.While the outlook for immediate economic development along the Lagos-Ibadan line is insignificant as illustrated by few residential and commercial build-outs around the railway station, some planned features of the railway raise hopes for future inland business opportunities. At present, inland producers face numerous challenges seeking to transport export goods to international markets, including cumbersome custom clearance procedures, high inland transport costs, and perennial congestion at the seaports.10 To address this issue, the Ibadan government announced a plan to add a dry port at the end of the Lagos-Ibadan SGR to facilitate expedited custom procedures and reduce congestion at Lagos ports in November 2018. A dry port is an inland intermodal terminal, facilitating a bidirectional flow of goods from inland areas to seaports by way of road or rail transfer.The planned Ibadan dry port would serve as a consolidation point, receiving cargo from Lagos ports and preparing goods from inland producers to be transferred to the coast. Notably, the planned port will also be a customs clearance spot for both export and import cargoes which would reduce the cargos processing time in Lagos.11 A well-functioning dry port in Ibadan would have the potential to serve as a pressure valve for congested port capacity in Lagos since goods could be transported directly up the rail line before undergoing customs processes in Ibadan. Conversely, exporters might enjoy expedited processing and transfer of goods from Ibadan to global destinations.However, potential gains offered by the dry port depend on timely completion of both the Lagos-Ibadan SGR and an operationally sound and bureaucratically sanctioned dry port. Recent imagery shows that Ibadan Station is far from complete, suggesting that the plans for the dry port, construction has not yet begun, may be delayed indefinitely. With the slow progress of railway construction and history of deferred deadlines by the Nigerian government, it is unlikely that the Nigerian government will pursue construction of the dry port any time soon.Although the Lagos-Ibadan SGR planners aspired to improve logistics and transport efficiency, poor connectivity between the rail line and existing industrial facilities, and a lack of blueprints for new industrial parks cast doubt on the prospect of local economic benefits along the Lagos-Ibadan corridor.ConclusionIt is no coincidence that railways are one of the most enduring symbols of industrialization and economic development. Throughout its many years of operation, the Lagos-Ibadan SGR will undoubtedly play an extended role in local economies along the rail line. However, high hopes for the future cannot displace the railway's inauspicious start in cultivating interconnections and physical development along the line.With a lack of infrastructure connecting industrial parks and facilities to the railway, along with unclear plans for a capacity-increasing dry port, economic spillover attributable to the Lagos-Ibadan SGR is modest at best. A handful of scattered residential developments along the trunk line cannot support a message of regional stimulus to the Nigerian economy. The future of the Ibadan dry port and associated optimism for the local economy will depend mainly on a coordinated policy response from the Nigerian government. In a separate Tearline article, we examine the intermodal connection between Lagos-Ibadan Railway and Lagos ports, exploring the potential and pitfalls for efficiency gains at Lagos ports, and the implications this may have for a diversified Nigerian export economy.Importantly, closing gaps in critical infrastructure remains at the top of the agenda for Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries. However, productive increases drawn from infrastructure development depend heavily on complementary policy support. In this sense, BRI infrastructure investment is not a quick fix, providing only one half of the equation for economic success. The future of the Lagos-Ibadan line, and the success of the BRI projects generally, can be fulfilled only if integrated into the broader framework of coordinated development policy.ReferencesCouncil on Foreign Relations. \"China's Massive Belt and Road Initiative\" February 21, 2019. https:\/\/www.cfr.org\/backgrounder\/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiativeEmmanuel Ukoh.

{"title":"The Ice Curtain: Why is there a new Russian military facility 300 miles from Alaska?","body":null,"content":"The Issue\". . . whoever holds the Arctic, holds the world. I think it is the most important strategic place in the world.\"These solemn words were uttered in 1935 before a House of Representatives Committee by a retired American general and aviator, Billy Mitchell, who presciently foresaw the Arctic as a vital region for early detection against missile and aviation threats to prevent an attack against the United States. But at the end of the Cold War, the Arctic ceased to be a strategically important place for either the United States or the Russian Federation. But by the 2007-2008 time frame, Russia began to re-prioritize the Arctic both economically and militarily--in keeping with Vladimir Putin's vision of restoring Russia's status as a great power and harnessing the Arctics economic potential. Now more than a decade later, Russia has returned to the Arctic militarily with important strategic implications for the United States.IntroductionIn 2007, the Russian Federation resumed regular air patrols over the Arctic Ocean and penetrated the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) 12-mile air defense identification zone around Alaska 18 times. Since 2007, Russia has adopted a series of policies and strategies and amended its military and maritime doctrines to include the Arctic region, emphasizing the need to protect Russia's Arctic territory and to project influence and power beyond its Arctic coastlines. In 2012, Russia announced the creation of an Arctic brigade and announced it would establish a missile defense system and deploy fighter aircraft to Novaya Zemlya, its northwestern archipelago, which separates the Barents and Kara Seas in 2013. By 2014, Russia announced an ambitious military force posture in the Arctic, which consisted of a new strategic command for the Arctic zone (the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command), the reopening of 50 former Soviet Arctic military bases, an increase in Russian special forces in the region by 30 percent by 2015, and a significant infrastructure program, which included \"13 air defense radar stations, an aviation training ground, and 10 technical radar and air guidance stations in the Arctic region.\"As Russia enhanced its military posture and forces in the Arctic, it concentrated on exercising its new capabilities in the context of territorial defense and power projection. In 2015, the Russian military launched an unannounced large-scale military exercise that involved more than 45,000 Russian forces, 15 submarines, and 41 warships and practiced full combat readiness in the Arctic. Russia's Northern Fleet, home to Russia's sea-based nuclear deterrent, conducted 4,700 exercises in 2017. The Zapad-2017 exercise featured missile strikes from its new base on Kotelny Island in the East Siberian Sea, where new facilities were completed along with now modernized bases in Novaya Zemlya and Franz-Josef Land, in the Barents Sea. In 2018, the Northern Fleet held around 3,800 test combat training exercises, with many designed to enhance both power-projection capabilities as well as protect strategic posts including the New Siberian Islands that are near potential oil and gas reserves and straddle the Northern Sea Route (NSR). Russian anti-submarine aircraft as well as attack and reconnaissance aircraft conducted over 100 Arctic Ocean patrols in 2018. The Russian military has already announced a new series of Arctic exercises, Tsentr-2019 (August-September), which will test new Russian weapons and air defense systems.A Focus on Remote Arctic Islands and Air Defense Systems: Wrangel Island as an ExampleRussia has significantly strengthened its military presence in its northernmost archipelagos by upgrading its bases on Wrangel Island, Kotelny Island, Franz Josef Land, on the shore of the Kara Sea, Alykel, Tiksi, Chokurdakh, Chersky, Kigelyakh, and Taymylyr. Many of these installations have airfields or will be equipped with with 2,500-meter runways that can receive Russian fighter aircraft. Similarly, each of these installations has or is scheduled to receive a radar detachment capable of improving domain awareness in Arctic airspace, and many are equipped with modern and sophisticated weaponry including the Rubezh coastal missile systems and the Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft weapon systems. It has been reported that Russia has deployed S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to the Novaya Zemlya archipelago and to the Yakutian port of Tiksi.Why has Russia stationed air defense assets on remote Arctic islands? Northern Fleet Commander Admiral Nikolay Yevmenov described these assets in August 2018 as a \"protective dome\" of anti-aircraft missile units strung along the Arctic to defend the airspace above the Russian Arctic. Is this the case?\n\n             Source: Wikimedia CommonsWrangel Island, an island nearly 300 miles from the Alaskan coast, is a clear example of Russia's growing Arctic military footprint and its strategic ambition, which may have implications for U.S. national security. In late August 2014, the Russian navy conducted a preliminary assessment of Wrangel Island in preparation for the establishment of a new naval base which would be \"the first-ever naval base on (Wrangel Island).\" Satellite imagery shows that actual construction of the new naval base likely began sometime between July 2015 and April 2016 and included the replacement of an abandoned and derelict Cold War era installation at Ushakovskiy.1 The new base includes a signature trefoil structure (three interconnected buildings designed to withstand extreme cold temperatures) as well as a number of support installations, such as the construction of a Sopka-2 radar installation. According to Russian officials, the installation will control civilian air traffic, provide meteorological data and monitor airspace for potentially hostile targets.\n\n  But the Sopka-2 on Wrangel Island is a 3D dual-use S-band air-route radar with a range of 350km. It faces east in an arc stretching from the Beaufort Sea in the north to the Bering Strait in the south, but its 350km maximum range means that its coverage does not extend into either. Additionally, the location of the Sopka-2 is below the peaks of the islands Gora Sovetskaya mountain to the west and northwest, which results in some terrain masking to avoid potential low- and medium-altitude threats from that direction. The significance of this limitation is unclear as the area to the west may be covered by other radar systems.2The first indications of the Sopka-2 installation were observed in commercial satellite imagery from May 13, 2016.3 The location chosen for the radar side is approximately 1,500 meters north northwest and above the trefoil base for safety reasons and 675 meters north northwest and above the communications facility to minimize interference.\n\n See trefoil structure for reference then note North arrow for direction to communications and radar sections of base.\n\n             Subsequent imagery from July 21, 2016, shows that the Sopka-2 installation and its elevated radome housing the systems three antennas was externally completed and enclosed by a tall wire fence.4 An elevated cable run--likely carrying data, communications, and backup power cables--was also in place connecting the installation to the communications facility and main base. Although tentative, the radar may not have been operational at this time. A subsequent image from August 31, 2018, shows a neatly organized pile of discarded shipping crates, which possibly contained the internal equipment required to complete the internal installation of the system. Initial tests of the Sopka-2 facility occurred in January during a simulation exercise.\n\n   Zoomed in shot of communications section.\n\n Zoomed in shot of radar section.\n\n   More work at radar section.\n\n             Is This Important?As one of its most easterly situated radar systems in the Russian Arctic, the Wrangel Island Sopka-2 radar is likely designed to supplement Russia's strategic early warning radar network and to detect U.S. aircraft. When viewed in isolation, an early warning radar system on Wrangel Island has limited strategic value and could easily be discounted. However, when viewed as part of a larger network of state-of-the-art radars covering the entirety of Russia's northern borders, including the Arctic Ocean and Russia's coastline, it may have greater importance. The Sopka-2 is a cueing radar, which means it collects data that could be used to direct more powerful radars located closer to the Russian mainland. The network would fill gaps over the Arctic and when combined with new over-the-horizon radars, would establish a detection field ranging from 900 to 1,200 miles beyond the country's borders. Russia's military footprint on Wrangel Island could gather intelligence on, detect, and possibly impact future U.S. military activity in the region.The Sopka-2 radars 350 km range and its intelligence gathering capabilities allows Russia to potentially gather intelligence and detect activity originating from U.S. military installations such as Eielson Air Force Base (AFB) and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson as well as Fort Greely army base, a key missile defense site and home to U.S. Ground-based Midcourse Defense interceptors. The pace of U.S. investments at Fort Greely has accelerated since 2013, primarily in response to a series of missile tests by North Korea and includes $200 million from Congress to add a fourth missile field with 20 additional interceptors over the next four years. The recently released U.S. missile defense strategy also increases the number of ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely from 44 to 64 over the next several years. Eielson AFB is projected to receive 54 F-35s between 2020 and 2022, increasing the capacity of the base in light of its strategic importance to defending the United States in the Indo-Pacific region. Elmendorf AFB is also the headquarters of Alaskan Command (ALCOM) and one of three NORAD regions that defend North American airspace which Russian bombers test from time to time.As Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson recently noted, superiority in the Arctic will depend heavily on airpower, which places renewed emphasis on early warning detection systems and aircraft. At present, it appears that the Wrangel Island radar system tracks regional and local air defense--including the provision of threat information from incoming aircraft--to local and regional surface-to-air missile units and air defense interceptors.5 But as Russia's aerial advancements in the Arctic advance, Russia may achieve integrated air and missile defense superiority.References and NotesAlthough recent commercial satellite imagery of Wrangel Island is readily available, weather conditions (e.g., snow, heavy cloud coverage, etc.) in the region often make ground observation very challenging, if not impossible. Additionally, historical commercial satellite imagery of the island is somewhat limited and subject to the same climactic challenges.Air-Route Double Purpose Radar Complex: SOPKA-2 (slide 2), ALMAZ R&P Corp, LEMZ Division, http:\/\/www.radartutorial.eu\/19.kartei\/03.atc\/pubs\/Sopka-2-1_en.pdf; Sopka-2 Air-Route Radar Complex, ALMAZ R&P Corp, LEMZ Division, http:\/\/www.lemz.ru\/en\/publicdata\/SOPKA-2.pdf.Due to snow cover and the angle of the winter Sun, much of the image is \"blown out.\" Enough detail, however, remains to make these observations.The fence is likely just as much a security measure as it is intended to keep local reindeer herds out.To date, no surface-to-air missile units have been observed on Wrangel Island.

Forthcoming analysis will focus on additional locations that make up a \"protective dome\" of military assets. \n\n In 2007 Russia re-prioritized the Arctic in keeping with Vladimir Putin's vision of restoring Russia's status as a great power. Now more than a decade later, Russia's military returns to the Arctic with strategic implications for the United States.  \n\n Wrangel Island exemplifies Russia\u2019s growing Arctic military footprint and its strategic ambitions.

However, when viewed as part of a larger network of state-of-the-art radars covering the entirety of Russia\u2019s northern borders, including the Arctic Ocean and Russia\u2019s coastline, it may have greater strategic importance.  \n\n Near Completion of Radar \n\n A subsequent image from August 31, 2018, shows a neatly organized pile of discarded shipping crates, which possibly contained the internal equipment required to complete the internal installation of the system. \n\n Sopka-2 Radar Installation Progress \n\n Subsequent imagery from July 21, 2016, shows that the Sopka-2 installation and its elevated radome housing the systems three antennas was externally completed and enclosed by a tall wire fence. \n\n New Radar Installed \n\n The first indications of the Sopka-2 installation were observed in commercial satellite imagery from May 13, 2016. \n\n Naval Base Renewal July 2015 - April 2016\n\n Satellite imagery shows that actual construction of the new naval base likely began sometime between July 2015 and April 2016 and included the replacement of an abandoned and derelict Cold War era installation at Ushakovskiy. The new base includes a signature trefoil structure (three interconnected buildings designed to withstand extreme cold temperatures) as well as a number of support installations, such as the construction of a Sopka-2 radar installation.\n\nFor reference of base layout, note trefoil structure (upper left), communications installation, then Sopka-2 radar area.

{"title":"A Snapshot of North Korea's Supply Chain Coal Activity","body":null,"content":"The August 2017 UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2371 was the most recent resolution passed that placed a number of sanctions against North Korea, probably the most critical of which was against its coal export industry. Rich in a number of natural resources, coal and limestone yield the most in mining tonnage each year, but arguably, coal has provided the greatest source of currency to the economically struggling nation. What imagery reveals about the country's coal production and distribution is an important piece to understanding the state and health of North Korea's coal industry.North Korea is heavily dependent on its natural resources for both its domestic energy production and trade for foreign currency. Of its many resources, mining plays a critical role, and coal is the dominant ore in terms of production. For many years, China has been the North's largest foreign consumer, accounting for approximately 40% of the DPRK's coal export market. However, now with a series of UNSC sanctions in place, the market dynamic for this resource has dramatically changed for North Korea.Monitoring North Korea's coal activity requires context and a timeline of key events to understand what is seen on imagery. In 2015, China stopped importing the North's anthracite coal due to its high sulfur content. This was, in part, an effort to help reduce its air pollution levels. Within a few months, however, coal imports began to flow again, but with tighter quality inspections.In 2016, in response to North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile tests, the UNSC passed two resolutions that placed increasing restrictions on the DPRK's coal exports. Resolution 2270 was unanimously passed in March 2016, banning the North's coal export except for livelihood purposes. In November 2016, Resolution 2321 was unanimously passed, reinforcing the export ban and placing strict limits on even the coal exports considered for livelihood purposes. In February 2017, China took the additional step to ban all coal imports from the DPRK through the end of the year. However, in early August 2017, prior to the issuance of Resolution 2371, China had resumed importing North Korean coal and was allowed a buffer period to complete its August transaction before it would begin its adherence to the new resolution. While initially compliant, there have been subsequent reports of sanctions violations by both the Chinese and Russians, as trading companies have sought to circumvent the agreement, accounting for many of the anomalies in the coal flow patterns observed in imagery.However, despite these increasing restrictions on North Korea's coal exports, the country's larger coal mines have remained active from 2015 to 2019 and improvements have been made to its coal supply-chain infrastructure.South Pyongan Coal RegionThe South Pyongan coal fields are estimated to hold deposits of approximately 1.23 billion tons of anthracite coal. In commercial satellite imagery of the Ryongun-ri, Ramjo-dong, and Namdok mining areas, there is a distinguishable increase in activity between 2015 to the present. Based on the imagery available, there has been notable growth of spoil piles around these mines, indicating active mining processes. There are also growing piles of coal on the ground and trucks seen consistently moving between the mines to rail and transfer stations and depots. Of the ten smaller and six larger mining complexes examined in this region, a number of the larger mines appear to be active while many of the smaller mines have been shut down.Figure 1. Overview of mine clusters at Ryongun-ri mining complex.\n\n             Figure 2. Overview of Ramjon-dong mining complex.\n\n             Regional Road-to-Rail Transfer StationsThe Taedong River and its tributaries wind through the Pyongan region, and rail lines follow along its shores, as the region is mountainous. There are numerous rail stations and coal depots along its length, most with direct access to the mine complexes located in the adjoining valleys. This report focuses on six observed in imagery over the period from 2015 to the present: Myonghak Station, Pongchang Station (near the Bukchang Concentration Camp), Oidong Station, Tukjang Station, Ryongmun Coal Mine Station, Sokan Station and an unnamed rail transfer station (39.55248, 126.05946) near the Oidong Station. Others, such as the Namdok Loading Depot, while large, had inadequate imagery coverage for a studied look.Figure 3. Overview of an unnamed coal transfer station in April 2013.\n\n             Figure 4. Overview of an unnamed station with additional mines and expanded coal piles.\n\n             Figure 5. Oidong Station in August 2016.\n\n             Figure 6. Oidong Station in January 2019 with increased coal stores.\n\n             The general trend for all has been an overall increase in stocks at each location, growing from 2015 to the present. Interestingly, despite 2017 being a tumultuous period for coal exports, no major observable decreases were observed. Of course, it is possible that movement had decreased, but the coal already stockpiled simply remained with no additional ore coming in.Figure 7. Mujindae Transfer Station showing significant collection of coal.\n\n             Coal Ports and Border Rail Classification YardsExport activity can be observed at both large and small coal ports. To a lesser extent, rail classification yards located at or near key border cities can also be used, but trains are more fleeting, and thus the monitoring of coal export volumes is difficult as rail cars, with or without ore loads, are likely to remain in a yard only briefly.The coal ports range in size from Nampo, the largest west coast port servicing the Pyongyang area, located on the mouth of the Taedong River, to Rajin, a medium-sized port, located on the east coast near the Russian border, to two small ports, the Sunchon Coal Port located northeast of Pyongyang on the Taedong River, and the Ryongchon Coal Port, located at the mouth of the Yalu River south of the Chinese city of Dandong. This report focuses on the smaller, regional coal ports. The other ports and the rail classification yards found along North Korea's borders will be addressed in later reports.Sunchon Coal PortLocated on the Taedong River, the coal port is relatively new. Imagery taken in March 2015 revealed empty land along the river. By July 6, 2017, however, construction activity had started on a large quay. By October 23, 2017, the quay had been completed, traveling gantry cranes had been installed, and stores of coal were piled onto it. The port's location suggests that it may have been planned for the movement of coal for internal consumption, albeit, its position on the Taedong River also makes it ideal for moving coal in greater volumes down to Nampo.Figure 8. Overview of Sunchon coal port in April 2013.\n\n             Figure 9. Sunchon coal port constructed and operational by October 2017.\n\n             Ryongchon Coal PortThe Ryongchon coal port is located near the mouth of the Yalu River, about 1.6 kilometers downstream from the Chinese city of Dandong. Like Sunchon, the port construction began in 2015 with the clearing of the area for a quay and other port facilities. Coverage was minimal, until March 2017, when the quay was observed to be complete, concrete was being poured for the deck area, and a long, 14-bay storage facility was under construction. By February 17, 2018, the building was completed, three small piles of coal were on the quay, and cargo trucks were queued just outside the security point on the road leading into the facilities.Figure 10. Proximity of Ryongchon coal port and rail transfer to the border with China.\n\n             Figure 11. Ryongchon coal port construction in March 2017.\n\n             Figure 12. Coal piles present at Ryongchon coal port.\n\n             Figure 13. Construction of storage building complete at Ryongchon coal port.\n\n             Figure 14. Overview of Ryongchon coal port in February 2019.\n\n             The coal stores are not as large as many of the other facilities and it is unclear why that is the case. The proximity to China facilitates potential short transfers across the river,which may be hard to detect. Furthermore, a couple of kilometers south, there is a sizable, covered rail-to-road transfer station. Ore cars have been observed there, but none have been seen loading or unloading ore. Given these conditions, the coal port and transfer facility merit further monitoring.Figure 15. Overview of Ryongchon rail transfer point.\n\n             ConclusionOverall, increasing restrictions on North Korea's coal export industry have not caused mining or supply-chain infrastructure development to collapse. While the country has traditionally valued coal more as a trading commodity than a source for domestic power production, Kim Jong Un did instruct in his 2019 New Year's address that coal should be redirected into the domestic market to better meet the country's energy needs and work toward energy self-sufficiency. Still, efforts to circumvent sanctions, especially on coal exports, are likely to persist, and thus monitoring the coal industry and its supply-chain infrastructure and activities must continue.

{"title":"China's BRI in Nigeria: Impact of Lagos-Ibadan Railway on Port Congestion - Part 2","body":null,"content":"Nigeria has long sought to expand its commercial infrastructure to stimulate sustainable growth and diversify the economy away from long-standing over-reliance on oil extraction. The nation's leaders hope that participating in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will facilitate Chinese financing and construction of parts of that infrastructure and help to unlock economic potential. In a previous Tearline article, we examined one of these projects, the high-capacity Lagos-Ibadan Railway now under construction and its secondary effects on local economies. In this Tearline Article we look at another question inexorably connected to the value of the Lagos-Ibadan line: are the necessary companion developments in place? After years of work by the China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC), a Chinese state-owned enterprise, the railway is scheduled to begin operating in June 2019. However, worsening traffic congestion in Lagos ports and skyrocketing transport costs may limit the expected contributions to diversification from this signature piece of infrastructure. Without more efficient rail and port interconnections at the sea-port end of the line, the expected benefits of the investment are likely to fall short, along with hopes for economic diversification.Rail Infrastructure and Nigeria's Export EconomyEconomic development in Nigeria has had ups and downs over the last decade, mostly as a result of the country's dependence on oil and commodity exports. More than 90% of Nigerian exports in 2017 and 2018 consisted of oil and petroleum products, and real GDP has declined since 2014 as oil prices have dropped (see graph 1). High hopes, promoted by Nigerian policymakers, have been placed on railway projects as a means of connecting inland areas to global markets. As part of an economic diversification agenda, the Lagos-Ibadan Railway seeks to connect the opportunity and resource rich interior to Apapa Port, the largest port in Lagos (see image 1), providing the means for diversified cargo including value added goods -- not just oil -- to pass from inland areas to global destinations.\n\n Connected infrastructure networks, including rail-to-port transfer points, have the potential to improve speed and efficiency along inland rail corridors. Such improvements are badly needed in Lagos ports, as gridlock traffic and port processing delays have contributed to an expensive and unattractive environment for importers and exporters. Since 2014, import traffic in Lagos has declined more than 30%, as transport inefficiencies have driven shippers towards neighboring ports in Togo and Benin. Over the same period, export traffic from Lagos Ports has also flattened, raising concerns over the costs of inefficiencies weighing on Nigeria's export industries. Addressing concerns over shipping costs in Lagos will require a coordinated policy response in support of integrated port transit systems.\n\n             Nigerian leaders identified connectivity between the Apapa port and the intermodal shipping transport system as a priority for addressing export costs in Lagos. To this end, the government announced plans to expand a system of rail extensions in the Lagos port complex in November 2018. New proposed rail extensions are planned to connect five export terminals in the Apapa port to the standard gauge railway network with the goal of achieving seamless connections between shipping terminals and inland rail hubs.1However, implementation of the ambitious plan to expand rail connections to all of Apapa's terminals has proven challenging. Expanding the planned connections from an initial 2.4 km to 6.4 km has been blamed for the Lagos-Ibadan Railway overrunning its USD $1.5 billion budget. Construction delays on the Lagos-Ibadan railway will likely delay commencement of operations along with the Apapa rail extension. The Apapa port extensions also require demolition of parts of the existing port layout, which depends on additional financing which has not yet been secured.Modernization of Lagos' ports is complicated by their distance from important existing infrastructures. Lagos' second largest port, Tin Can Island, is difficult to integrate with the Apapa areas as it has no pre-existing rail capacity and is separated by a dense network of shipping infrastructure.2\n\n             The layout of Lagos' ports reflects the legacy industries they were designed to accommodate. Existing storage and terminal infrastructure near the Apapa rail extension was built to handle oil exports, while Tin Can Island Port supports processing of agricultural goods, vehicles, and light manufactured goods.3 Satellite imagery shows that the port terminals nearby (directly east) to Lagos' rail freight terminus facilities are ill-suited for the rapid transfer of consumer, agricultural, and light manufactured goods: oil tanks and oil pipeline infrastructure dominate this zone, hard-wiring it to petroleum import-export use, not handling of diversified goods.\n\n  While oil flows efficiently via pipeline directly to the terminals in the port, shipping containers carrying agricultural and manufactured goods must be laboriously offloaded at the Apapa rail extension, warehoused, then re-loaded onto trucks. From there, goods are transferred to ship loading sites within Apapa port or transported to Tin Can Island. Delicate high-value goods, such as fruits and other foodstuffs, are vulnerable to spoilage on trucks waylaid in standstill traffic surrounding Tin Can Island. The Lagos-Ibadan rail line may open the door to moving inland products and produce sound to port, but poorly integrated rail-to-port connections at the Apapa rail terminus make that of little use.Ongoing Logistical ChallengesCurrently, export goods arriving at Lagos by road are unloaded at private warehouses and inspected by a private customs contractor. Goods often languish in warehouses for up to three days after inspection while waiting for the inspection certificate required to pass through the port. From there, goods are re-loaded onto trucks and may spend up to 48 hours in transit to port terminals, largely a result of poorly-maintained roads and stand-still traffic congestion. The imagery of Tin Can Island shows severe traffic delays extending up to 7km from Tin Can Island's looping road system.Roads around Tin Can and Apapa port typically become clogged with trucks transporting import and export goods. Efforts by the Nigerian Port Authority to address traffic congestion, such as secure off-road parking sites for trucks awaiting delivery, have fallen short of expectations to reduce transport delays. Traffic has become so severe that, in February 2018, the Nigerian Port Authority began running a barge service in Apapa port to facilitate the transfer of goods.4\n\n            With the Lagos-Ibadan Railway scheduled to begin operation in May 2019, the degree to which the railway can reduce transport costs in Lagos is now an obvious question that should have been addressed earlier. By channeling goods into a terminus at Apapa that is poorly networked to Apapa port or Tin Can Island, the rail line will amplify congestion problems. As of 2016, transport from warehouses to Lagos port terminals cost an average of $434\/TEU for a 20-foot container, mostly due to traffic delays in the city. Apapa terminus to Tin Can Island shipment will remain reliant on truck transport and vulnerable to heavy costs.Unlike the jammed roads servicing Tin Can Island from the east, recent imagery shows just mild congestion in the warren of streets dividing the Apapa and Tin Can Island port complexes. However, inadequate road infrastructure linking Apapa to Tin Can Island could quickly become jammed with traffic transporting goods from the Apapa rail terminus to Tin Can Island once the Lagos-Ibadan railway begins operation. Even with existing traffic delays on Tin Can Island, perishable agricultural goods from inland regions are vulnerable to spoilage during the truck transport phase. As a result, traffic congestion and associated delays are likely to remain key obstacles for inland export industries.\n\n             Evaluating Port ConnectivityInsights can be drawn from efforts elsewhere to ensure that expensive long-line railroads are not left stranded due to poor planning for \"last-mile\" issues at their port terminus. As a benchmark for connectivity improvement, we look at the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway in East Africa. Like the Lagos-Ibadan Railway, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti line was constructed by the CCECC and connects inland regions to a major regional port. Completed in 2016, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway has drawn attention for its role in Ethiopia's initiative to expand exports to Europe and Asia by way Djibouti's ports, enabling the production and export of perishable and high-value-added products, such as cut flowers and coffee.5 In anticipation of port congestion associated with increased trade flows, the Djibouti Port Authority initiated an ambitious program of intermodal connections at the Port of Doraleh, including the construction of a direct connection to the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, along with warehouse expansions, LNG and crude oil terminals, and container bunk ports.6The imagery of the Doraleh Multipurpose Port is a stark contrast to Apapa port in Lagos. An emergent infrastructural complex in a previously sparsely developed area, construction, and expansion in Doraleh were much more straightforward than in Lagos. Djibouti's port area suffers from major congestion only in peak shipping seasons, whereas traffic congestion and shipping delays in Lagos are constant.Replicating the Port of Doraleh's state-of-the-art infrastructure in Lagos is physically difficult, due to the dense network of existing warehouses and port terminals, and complicated with the institutional challenges of negotiating with myriad stakeholders. Rail extensions in Lagos to accommodate CCECC's new high-capacity standard-gauge rail in the Apapa Port Complex, required controversial demolition of warehouses and shipping terminals.7 Making remedial plans to deal with connectivity in time to handle the flow of goods arriving to the Apapa but destined for Tin Can or other shipping points would take years, at best.Conclusion about this BRI projectThe extension of the standard-gauge rail line to the Apapa port in Lagos is an important step towards modernizing and improving Lagos shipping infrastructure. However, the current freight terminus at the Apapa port is not enabled to relieve transport delays and reduce costs for Nigerian exporters. Under current circumstances, the Apapa terminal fails to address critical port congestion around Tin Can Island Port Complex and, short of extending the railway freight extension to support the diversified export infrastructure at Tin Can Island, undermines optimism about upstream diversification and economic development. Without both long-haul and last-mile connectivity, BRI projects like the Lagos-Ibadan line will fall short of helping Nigeria diversify from oil dependence. Long-term investments in transport infrastructure such as rail can be crucial for development, but the financing and capital project advantage China brings to a complex setting such as Nigeria is just one variable in a complex development equation.ReferencesFG to link 5 Lagos Port terminals with standard gauge rail.

The existing  budget overrun may impact completion of railway extensions in Lagos Port, and will necessitate a closer look at the cost and feasibility of the proposed rail extensions. Meanwhile, a tangible solution for Tin Can Island port's congestion is still pending, leaving the outlook for cost-efficient activity in Lagos' ports, not to mention a viable export strategy for Nigeria's inland producers, deeply uncertain.  \n\n A new rail extension to Apapa port aims to connect Nigeria\u2019s hinterland to global markets to diversify its economy. However, the rail extension may fail to address severe congestion in Lagos\u2019 port areas and high shipping costs will remain.\n\n Built by the China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC), the standard-gauge rail connection in Lagos' Apapa port faces many obstacles and will not alleviate traffic through Lagos\u2019 ports with ongoing congestion hampering efforts to diversify the Nigerian export economy away from oil. \n\n This Tearline article analyzes micro-level impacts of BRI infrastructure projects on local economies through geospatial analysis of Lagos-Ibadan Railway's potential impacts to Lagos' Ports. \n\n Revised Project Completion Date\n\n In April 2019, Nigeria's Minister of Transportation extends the Lagos-Ibadan railway's expected completion to June 2019.

Kirikiri-Apap Oworonshoki intersection is a major transportation junctions handling traffic flow to Tin Can Island port.\n\n Road Conditions between Apapa and Tin Can\n\n Moderate truck traffic has been observed in the roads connecting Apapa port and Tin Can Island port. Rail freight destined for Tin Can Island must be loaded onto trucks at the Apapa rail terminus and transferred by road. Trucks must traverse a primarily industrial area separating the ports. With narrow roads that are poorly suited to heavy traffic, there is significant potential for congestion in this area once the Lagos-Ibadan railway begins operation. \n\n Traffic Overview and Port Layout in Tin Can Island Port\n\n Heavy truck traffic has been observed throughout Tin Can Island port's road complex, deepening traffic problems on roads feeding into the port.\n\n Lagos-Ibadan Railway Budget Overrun\n\n On November 21, 2018, Nigerian media reports a cost overrun request filed with Federal Executive Council (FEC).

{"title":"Developments in North Korea's Sinuiju City under Kim Jong-un","body":null,"content":"Sinuiju is the home of North Korea's most utilized road and railway trade arteries, yet the city's transportation infrastructure has not been a high priority for government investment. The road from Sinuiju to Anju (half the distance to Pyongyang) is still an unpaved dirt road. Additionally, the World War II-era China-DPRK Friendship Bridge used to facilitate trade with China, North Korea's largest trading partner, consists of just a single traffic lane and railway crossing and it is frequently closed for maintenance.National and local leaders have on multiple occasions sought foreign investment to improve infrastructure in Sinuiju through the establishment of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ). However, there has been little real progress. China built a new four-lane suspension bridge to Sinuiju at a cost of nearly $350 million to serve as an alternate transportation corridor, but North Korea has not allowed the new bridge to become operational since being largely completed in 2014. A Chinese company has also constructed a tourist resort on the Yalu\/Amnok river to serve Chinese tourists, however, its utilization appears to be far below capacity, and its impact on local infrastructure is negligible.

The kinds of projects being undertaken in Sinuiju, such as a new stadium, a new theater, school renovations, and new park construction are nearly identical to construction taking place in other provincial capitals, making it representative point of observation for signature projects of the Kim Jong-un era. However, it remains unclear just how popular and effective these centrally-driven projects are at meeting local demand for entertainment and generating political goodwill towards Pyongyang.

Sinuiju rests at the end of the Yalu\/Amnok River across from the Chinese City of Dandong, and due to its geographic location, it is a vitally important link in trade between the two countries.\n\nIn the Text\/Timeline\/Graph features, we explore some of these economic and showcase political projects.\n\n Propaganda and Railway Projects,\n\n Since coming to power, Kim Jong-un has promoted a propaganda campaign to secure the memories of his father and grandfather. In this picture we can see new Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il statues that were constructed in front of the provincial revolutionary museum, which was also renovated. These are very typical of the kind of propaganda construction projects that have taken place not just in Pyongyang, but at each of the provincial level cities. Today it appears that new Kim statues are being constructed in smaller cities and at corp-level military units.  This picture also shows the completed renovation of the Sinuiju Youth Train Station. According to public satellite imagery, renovation work started in late 2011 and was completed by October 2016. The most significant change appears to be the addition of a covered platform at the main railway yard.\n\n Skate Park, 3D Rhythmic Cinema, and Traffic School \n\n Skate parks, movie theaters, and traffic schools are typical service facilities being constructed nationally. At the bottom of the picture we can see a typical roller skating park. Parks like this are being built down to the town and worker's district level. Above the skate park we can see the octagonal \"3D Rhythmic Cinema.\" Based on video footage in the official media, these are comparable to 4D cinemas, which incorporate 3D video with other physical effects to manipulate the senses. Satellite imagery indicates that these theaters are being constructed outside of Pyongyang in each provincial level city. Next to the cinema we can see the new Sinuiju Children's Traffic School. Based on a model school in Pyongyang, traffic schools are being constructed nationwide down to the local town level, even in remote areas where vehicular traffic, and traffic accidents, must be a rare occurrence.\n\n Sinuiju Instrument Measuring Factory \n\n On September 4, 2015, North Korean media reported that Kim Jong-un visited the Sinuiju Instrument Measuring Factory. Although the name of the factory sounds unassuming, satellite imagery of the site reveals that it contains facilities for storing explosives, indicating a potential military purpose. Shortly after Kim Jong-un's visit, the factory began an extensive renovation that appears to be nearing completion. This pattern of activity, where Kim Jong-un visits a military factory and orders its renovation, has been seen in other plants as well including the January 18 General Machine Plant, Kangdong Precision Machine Plant, Sinhung Machine Factory, and the Tonghungsan Machine Plant. \n\n Sinuiju Baby Home, Orphanage, Primary and Secondary Schools \n\n North Korea runs a segregated orphanage system where affected children reside and are educated in specialized nurseries and schools until they reach adulthood. One of Kim Jong-un's signature public works campaigns has been the re-design and construction of new national orphanage facilities at the provincial level. According to the official media, these \"cradles of love\" contain  amenities such as nursing and education rooms, intelligence toys rooms, dancing rooms, combined amusement rooms, indoor wading pools, combined physical exercise rooms and medical treatment rooms. The provincial level orphanages are based on model facilities first constructed in the city of Wonsan, Kangwon Province.  \n\n Sinuiju Stadium Renovation \n\n Sinuiju Stadium underwent renovations in November of 2016, but was largely completed by the end of 2017. The original stadium was reportedly built in 1965 and seated 17,500 people. Efforts continue nationwide at both the provincial and county level to rebuild, renovate, and upgrade stadiums and gymnasiums. This policy is reflected in annual cabinet reports on the national budget as well where since 2012 North Korea has specifically reported spending increases on \"sports.\" \n\n Sinuiju High-Rise Apartments \n\n Starting in 2013, a number of high-rise apartments have been constructed in the central neighborhoods of Sinuiju around Chaeha-dong. These high-rises are perhaps the most significant economic development in the city. Reports from inside North Korea indicate that much of the construction and financing for these buildings is being managed by private actors in cooperation with state oversight who are responding to market demand for more\/better housing in the city.  Units in this complex reportedly cost between $20,000-$30,000. Development of this project indicates that the old socialist system of assigned housing continues to gradually give way to a de-facto private property market.\n\n Amnok River Waterpark \n\n The Amnok River Waterpark was largely completed by August 30, 2013, when it was featured on state television. It features a 50m pool, two diving platforms, two water slides (possibly manufactured by the KPA's December 7 Factory), locker rooms, and restaurant. Similar water parks have been built and renovated in Haeju, Nampho, Phyongsong, Hamhung, Rason, and Kanggye. North Korea has also reportedly constructed a water park in the Kamchatka Territory of Russia. \n\n North Phyongan Veteran Sanatorium \n\n Sanatoriums for veterans of the Korean War have been built in most North Korean provinces. Each sanatorium, nearly identical in construction, reportedly has a total floor space of several thousand square meters, service facilities like physical therapy, gymnasiums, barber shops, fishing, and other activities. \n\nAccording to KCNA, \"Unable to repress the excitement at the grateful benevolence of the Workers' Party of Korea, which is glorifying the lives of the war veterans, [veterans] are fully resolved to repay the benevolence by implanting the spirit of defending the leader unto death and the spirit of defending the country in the 1950s in the minds of the rising generation.\" \n\nSinuiju Chaeha Market Upgrade \n\n In 2012, Sinuiju's centrally-located and largest market, the Chaeha-dong Market, was relocated to the outskirts of the city. A new skate park was built on the site of the former market and that was partially demolished to build new high-rise apartments. The new market location is larger, giving more space to vendors and presumably generating more local tax revenue. Another improvement is the addition of a large parking lot, which will improve the availability of goods in the market. The experience of this market is very typical of markets in the Kim Jong-un era. Since the current leader assumed power, nearly two-dozen new markets have been constructed and hundreds have been renovated or expanded like this one.  \n\n Amnok River Tourist Area \n\n The Amnok River Tourist Area is the only noticeable economic project that has been completed in Sinuiju involving a foreign investor, the Dandong International Travel Agency. An opening ceremony for the facility was held on December 22, 2015, but with a capacity of 10,000 tourists at a time, it has been drastically under-utilized. The reported cost of the 130,000 sqm facility was 50 million yuan, which investors hoped to recoup with tour packages costing approximately 300 yuan. Amenities at the facility include duty free shopping, North Korean restaurants, a theater, and live artistic performances. It is unclear from open sources how popular the project is, but satellite imagery indicates minimal activity.","authors":["Curtis Melvin"],"categories":["North Korea's Economy"],"tags":["construction","curtis","development","economy","odni","sinuiju","urbanization"],"url":"http:\/\/www.tearline.mil\/public_page\/u-developments-in-north-koreas-sinuiju-city-under-kim-jong-un\/","id":230}
{"title":"North Korea\u2019s Hydroelectric Power - The Tanchon Power Station Project","body":null,"content":"BackgroundAt first glance, North Korea's mountainous terrain and numerous riverine systems would seem ideal for hydroelectric power production, and it was the vision of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il which drove the country to undertake the construction of large-scale hydroelectric power station dams. The Huichon Power Stations No. 1 and 2 were intended to be the crown jewel of that effort. Kim Jong Un initially embraced that strategy, but as poor engineering and extreme weather patterns caused continued setbacks, the country shifted efforts to build more easily constructed and reliable, small-to-medium-sized power plants, built in tiers (in series), to help close the electrical energy gap.The exemplar of this trend was described in Part I of this series on North Korea's hydroelectric power system. That report focused on the Chongchon River and the 12 Huichon power stations located along its length. Huichon Power Stations No. 1 and 2 represent the large hydroelectric stations, each supported by their own reservoir to supply the necessary water volume to power their turbine generators. The more efficient, small-to-medium-sized hydroelectric plants are represented by the tiered spacing of Huichon Power Stations No. 3 to 12.A third strategy for generating hydroelectric power can be found in the northeastern province of South Hamgyong, where Hochongang Power Stations No. 1 to 4 are located. These power stations are nontraditional, in that the water supply that drives their turbines does not come from an adjacent river or dam, but is received through a complex series of pipes and tunnels drawing water from distant reservoirs. Each of these power stations have large substations co-located with them. How successful the Hochongang power plants have been is not known, but the new, highly touted Tanchon Power Station project is incorporating major tunnel waterways into its design.Figure 1. Overview of the Tanchon Power Station Region.\n\n    The hydroelectric Tanchon Power Station was first mentioned in Kim Jong Un's New Year's address in 2016, and again in his 2017 address. While details of the project have been sparse, a May 2017 article published in the Pyongyang Times featured an interview with Hong Jong Min, a member of the construction panel at the field headquarters. When asked about \"the scale, phased goals and prospect of the project,\" he explained:The project involves the construction of several main dams and power plants that use the Jangjin, Hochon, Karim and other rivers and streams, as well as waterway tunnels running over a hundred kilometers. The construction of the power station, which is expected to generate several hundred thousand kilowatts . . .is the largest-ever project in the country's history of building hydropower stations.The station is featured by long waterway tunnels. Several main waterway tunnels extend for well over a hundred kilometers in total. It is also needed to dig dozens of kilometers of tunnels for water collection. The waterway tunneling is believed to be several times as long as that of the iconic Anbyon Youth Power Station. As the waterway tunneling is more difficult than the building of dams . . .the power station construction can be claimed to be an unprecedented one in the country. At present service personnel and other powerful construction forces are engaged in the tunneling project.For its unprecedentedly huge scale, the project will be conducted [sic], divided into two stages. The first stage includes the building of dozens of kilometers of waterway tunnel No. 1, power station No. 5 and its dam and power station No. 6. (Emphasis added.)Activity at Sinhong DamConstruction of the Tanchon Power Station Project officially began with a ribbon cutting ceremony on May 18, 2017, although a power shovel was present in imagery of the dam site on November 17, 2016. By November 1, 2017, construction had begun on the dam and continued in earnest with the presence of two cranes on March 29, 2018. A March 18, 2018 KCNA article referenced the arrival of the additional crane, and, for the first time, referenced the dam as the Sinhong Dam.Figure 2. Early construction at Sinhong Dam, November 2017.\n\n    By July 31, 2018, just four months later, rapid progress had been made. In March, foundation sections for the dam were in place on the west side of the river but by July, the river had been spanned and the dam's height had risen considerably. In addition, a concrete tailrace for the co-located generator hall, Power Station No. 5, was in place. By September 19, 2019, the dam was nearing its final configuration and height, however, the oblique viewing angle from the north precluded seeing any detail regarding the power station.Figure 3. Final configuration of Sinhong Dam, September 2019.\n\nImagery courtesy of DigitalGlobe\n\n             Four hundred meters downstream of the dam, tunneling activity along the west side of the riverbed has been ongoing since November 2017. Three openings, each supported by four conveyors to remove debris, are in place, and spoil piles are near to each. Three pairs of large diameter pipes were observed aligned along the river in March 2018 but have since been covered. Although the activity is related to construction, its intended purpose cannot be determined at this time.Activity at Tanchon Power Station No. 1Tanchon Power Station No. 1 is located 2 km downstream from Sinhong Dam. Excavation for the power station foundation was first observed in imagery of November 1, 2017. The station's construction, like that of the Sinhong Dam, has moved forward at a remarkable pace. In imagery from September 18, 2019, the walls of the generator hall are nearly complete, but the roof has not been put in place, exposing the interior where the turbines are located. Stanchions for penstocks, which will feed into the hall, are in place, but the pipes for the penstocks are not present. The penstocks will run uphill to where a concrete surge tank has been constructed. The surge tank is the hub connecting the waterway tunnel to the penstocks and serves to regulate the water flow driving the generator hall turbines.Figure 4. Overview of Tanchon Power Station No. 1, September 2019.\n\n Imagery courtesy of DigitalGlobe\n\n             Located approximately 100 meters to the south is Hochongang Power Station No. 1. The two power stations are very similar in layout and design, with the exception that a large substation is located adjacent to it, whereas no substation has yet to be identified for Tanchon Power Station No. 1. In addition, the penstocks for Hochongang Power Station No. 1 reach further into the mountains, before connecting to any waterway tunnel.Immediately to the north of Tanchon Power Station No. 1 is another, smaller power station, possibly Station No. 6 referenced in the October 8, 2018 KCNA report, but with little detail.1 Construction of this station, which is half scale compared to Station No. 1, was first detected in March 2018. Again, construction has moved along at a rapid pace, and like Power Station No. 1, much of the exterior of the generator hall is complete, absent a roof.Activity of Waterway TunnelsThe construction of the waterway tunnels merits a separate discussion. While little can be seen of them, evidence of their presence and pathways can be found. To the west and northwest of the Tanchon Power Station complex are several reservoirs, any of which could be a source for a waterway tunnel. These lakes and reservoirs include three nearby, smaller ones, where one flows into the next. They are the Hwangsuwon, the Naejung and the Yangphyong Reservoirs, the latter where the Hochongang Dam is located. They are located 30 km, 18 km and 11 km, respectively, away from, and are known to feed into, the Hochongang Station No. 1 and the Tanchon project. Much farther to the west is the Jangjin (also called the Battle of Chosin Reservoir), the Pujon-ho, the Rangrim Dam and Phungso Dam reservoirs. They are located approximately 107 km, 80 km, 106 km and 40 km, respectively, away. These reservoirs share certain commonalities in that they were constructed decades ago and each have a large dam to contain their water, but none have a large power plant or substation co-located with them. Historical coverage of these reservoirs is sparse, but two, Pujon-ho and Jangjin, have visible pumping stations located within each reservoir, but distant from their containment dam. The Jangjin pumping station is a tower-type, similar to the one found in the Ryongrim Reservoir, which feeds the water tunnel supporting Huichon Power Station No. 1. While the distance of Jangjin to the Tanchon power project is greater than 100 km, and there's little visible evidence to otherwise suggest the two locations are connected by a tunnel waterway, the Jangjin River was specifically mentioned by Hong Jong Min as being related to the Tanchon Power Station.Figure 5. Close-up of the waterway tunnels at Tanchon Power Station No. 1.\n\n    Figure 6. Overview of Hochongang Power Station No. 1 with visible penstocks.\n\n    The Samsu Power Station Dam and Reservoir, located in the Ryanggang Province, approximately 55 km northwest of the Tanchon Power Station project, is an exemplar for waterway tunneling as it provides visual signatures for tracing their pathway, in this case, to the Tanchon project. According to a January 2019 Daily NK article, the Samsu Power Plant had ceased operations in 2014 due to continued leaking. Although not mentioned in the article, there is ongoing construction work at a large pumping station approximately 12 km south of the dam and evidence of trying to transport that reservoir water south to the Tanchon Power Station project. The visual signatures include the construction of the large pumping station and a linear sequence of tens of tunnel adits with light blue spoil piles, which are traceable going in a southernly direction from the pumping station toward the Tanchon project. These adits are needed because of the tunnel lengths and, therefore, openings are necessary to extract tunneling debris and allow worker access. As such, the adits and their attendant spoil piles become a unique signature in tracing a tunnel's route.ConclusionThe Tanchon Power Station Project is an ambitious and complex engineering strategy that relies on a system of dams, waterway tunnels, and power stations designed to provide a constant source of water to ensure the consistent generation of electrical power in the several hundreds of thousand-kilowatt range.One notable feature to this strategy not seen in the Chongchon River system or the hydropower projects in the northwest region of the country is the use of underground waterways to improve the consistency of water provision to its hydroelectric power plants. This, in conjunction with the promotion of building both large and small-to-medium-sized power stations, is intended to improve the delivery of electrical energy to the nation.Notes1. Construction of Tanchon Power Station Progresses Apace on in DPRK, KCNA, October 8, 2019. References \n\n In the near term, we would expect to see the rapid completion of Tanchon Power Stations No. 1, 5 and 6 and the Sinhong Dam, to include the construction of additional substations intended to link into the national electrical power grid. In the longer term, we expect to see the construction of additional waterway tunnel-fed power stations and dams. \n\n To help meet North Korea\u2019s electrical energy needs, it has placed great emphasis on the use of hydropower. One strategy to improve this sector has been to shift focus from large-scale dams and hydropower plants to smaller ones, arranged in tiers. \n\n In the northeast, hydropower plants employ another strategy for improving hydroelectric power generation: the water supply that drives their turbines does not come from an adjacent source, but is received through a complex series of large reservoirs and a vast, integrated system of waterway tunnels.\n\n GEOINT analysis shows rapid construction progress for what is categorized as a large-scale dam project.

{"title":"Mining North Korea: Magnesite Production at the Taehung Youth Hero Mine","body":null,"content":"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, more commonly known as North Korea) is a nation with immense non-ferrous and rare-earth mineral reserves.1 Among these is magnesite, which has been mined in commercially viable quantities since the Japanese colonial period. While the estimates of North Korean magnesite reserves has fluctuated dramatically over the past 15 years, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that North Korea has 2.3 billion metric tons of magnesite reserves and that its total 2018 mine production of magnesite was 270,000 metric tons.2 While this is a decline from the 380,000 metric ton estimate for 2017, most likely due to international sanctions imposed during 2017, it remains both an important export and domestic commodity for North Korea.3 Among the nations that have purchased magnesite from North Korea during the past 10 years, China is the largest customer by a large margin. Foreign analysts, especially in South Korea, believe that China's large long-term purchases of North Korean rare-earth and non-ferrous minerals, including magnesite, are a component of a strategy to lock out competitors and influence world market pricing.4North Korea's magnesite reserves are primarily distributed in Hambuk and Hamnam provinces in the northeastern part of the country, with 90 percent being located in the Tanchon area of Hamnam province. The remaining 10 percent are located in the Paegam-gun area of Ryanggang province and scattered around the nation.5 Among the magnesia-related facilities within Hambuk and Hamnam provinces are the Namgye Mine, Ryongyang Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory, Ryongyang Mine, Saengjang Mine, Songjin Refractory Factory, Ssangyong Mine, Taehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory, and the Taehung Youth Hero Mine.6Taehung Youth Hero Mine IntroductionLocation:The Taehung Youth Hero Mine (40.901815 128.804703), commonly referred to as the Taehung Mine, is located in Tanchon-gun (Tanchon county), Hamnam (South Hamgyong province) and approximately 350 kilometers north-northeast of Pyongyang and 20 kilometers northeast of the Ryongyang Mine. 7 The Taehung Youth Hero Mine, located on the southern hill mass above Puktuilryong (Puktuil Pass), and the Ryongyang Mine are the largest magnesite mines in North Korea and some of the largest in the world.8Management: The Taehung Youth Hero Mine, along with the Ryongyang Mine, is a component of the considerably larger Tanchon District Mining Bureau that oversees mining in Tanchon-gun.9 This bureau is itself subordinate to the Ministry of Mining Industry and mining rights are granted by the central government in Pyongyang.10 Magnesite mining operations under the bureau extend north from the port city of Tanchon, distributed along the valleys of the Namdae-chon (i.e., Namdae stream) and Puktae-chon (i.e., Puktae stream).Reserves and Production: While a May 2018 South Korean report placed the magnesite reserves at the Taehung Youth Hero Mine at 640 million tons, a North Korean report from mid-2018 states, somewhat improbably, that the mine possesses \"a high-grade magnesite deposit of more than 5 billion tons.\"11 The mine's magnesite is reportedly of high-grade, being 46.5-46.7 percent magnesium oxide, a naturally occurring form of magnesium.12 The mine is also reported to contain \"deposits of white talcum, chlorite, arsenious anhydride, red granite and other useful minerals amounting to hundreds of millions of tons.\"13 South Korea estimates the annual production capacity at the Taehung Youth Hero Mine to be 1 million tons of ore.The Taehung Youth Hero Mine reportedly alternates between open-pit surface and underground mining operations at the Muhak-tong Branch Mine, with underground mining operations being employed during the winter season. The ratio of the mine production is reported to be 70 percent open-pit mining to 30 percent underground mining.Processing and Distribution: In addition to the mining of magnesite ore and the production of magnesite concentrate by the Taehung Youth Hero Mine, the Taehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory reportedly produces \"high-quality magnesia clinker\" and other magnestite products.14 The ore, clinker, magnesite products, and other ore produced by the Taehung Youth Hero Mine are shipped in bulk by rail to the Tanchon Magnesia Factory, Songjin Refractory Factory, and ports of Tanchon and Kimchaek.15Analysis: As observed in all satellite imagery reviewed for this report, the size of the processing facilities, level of rail activity, presence of surface mine equipment (e.g., ore haul trucks, drill rigs, and shovels), activity at vehicle maintenance and storage facilities, expanding footprint of the area covered by mine tailings and general levels of activity strongly indicate that the Taehung Youth Hero Mine is an active mine and suggest that it may be the primary producer of magnesite ore, magnesia, magnesia clinker, and related products in the Puktae-chon Valley - which includes Ryongyang Mine.While North Korean sources repeatedly talk of increased production from the Taehung Youth Hero and Ryongyang mines, it is clear that four factors have inhibited and will continue to inhibit any dramatic increase in production:The facilities, equipment, and processes used in magnesite extraction and processing are antiquated and in desperate need of modernization.Despite being close to major hydroelectric power plants, electricity shortages continue to plague industrial facilities throughout Hamnam and Hambuk Provinces due to antiquated equipment and a failing distribution network. A South Korea Mine Survey team's 2011 report states that North Korean mines \"have very weak electric systems and low-quality electricity (voltage values in North Korea are approximately 130-205 V, normal voltage is 220V) and frequency variations are 39-54Hz (normal frequency is 60Hz).\"16 This low-quality or \"dirty\" electricity, when it is available, causes excessive wear on electrical equipment.17Despite North Korean propaganda claims, flood damage caused by the August 2012 Typhoon Bolaven (known locally as Typhoon-15) has had long-lasting effects that have not been fully addressed as late as 2018.18Finally, analysis of open source reporting concludes that international sanctions limiting North Korea's ability to export minerals continue to affect the magnesite industry, as well as North Korea's overall economy. By limiting foreign currency earning, sanctions effect the North's ability to acquire spare parts or replace antiquated equipment.Taehung Youth Hero MineThe Taehung Youth Hero Mine is frequently identified in both North Korean and South Korean sources and described as consisting of collections of facilities including the Puktu-dong Branch Mine (Taehung Youth Hero Mine), Muhak-tong Branch Mine, Taehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory, additional processing and production facilities, and a number of support facilities (e.g., railroad stations and electrical substations). Additionally, satellite imagery shows the presence of housing, agricultural, social, and other facilities that support the workers from the mine and political and social entities. These activities spread out along approximately 10 kilometers of the upper reaches of the Puktae-chon Valley's branches and are concentrated near Taehung-ni, Yangchon-dong, Muhak-tong, and Puktu-dong.19 The Puktae-chon Valley is served by what is popularly known as the Tanchon-Kumgol electrified branch rail line that passes through 29 railroad tunnels before reaching the end of the line at the Muhak-tong rail yard.20 The Taehung Youth Hero Mine itself is serviced by the three rail yards\/stations at Taehung-ni, Yangchon-dong, and Muhak-tong.\n\n  Overview image of the area containing the Taehung Youth Hero Mine, Mutak-dong Branch Mine, and the surrounding ore processing and mining facilities, July 6, 2019. (Copyright 2019 by Maxar Technologies)\n             Although the precise details concerning the mine's organization and the specific locations of its various activities and facilities are lacking, the following are among the most often reported in the open source:21Puktu-dong Branch Mine (Taehung Youth Hero Mine) 22Muhak-tong Branch Mine23Muhak-tong ore processing and loading facilitiesTaehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory at Yangchon-dong24Briquette FactoryLight-burned Magnesia Factory.25One source also identifies four mines named Hyoksin, Paksan, 6.22, and Red-flag, although it is unclear whether some of these are the same or different from those named above.With the combination of both satellite imagery and open-source reporting (including North Korean-provided ground imagery), some of these activities can be located with relatively reliable accuracy. Others, however, simply cannot be located with accuracy at the present time due to the lack of reliable information and challenges in disambiguating the information that is available.Located approximately 14 kilometers up the Puktae-chon Valley from Kumgol (Komdok) is the village of Taehung-ni. It is here that the area of the Taehung Youth Hero Mine can be said to begin. Here, a road forks to the east and climbs up the mountain past Hakkyo-maul and Puktu-dong to the site of the Puktu-dong Branch Mine. The rail line and main road continue north through Yangchon-dong and the Taehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory and other processing facilities before turning east to Muhak-tong and the ore processing and loading facilities.The village of Taehung-ni extends approximately 3.5 kilometers along both sides of the Puktae-chon and approximately 1 kilometer up the branch road to the Puktu-dong Branch Mine. Examination of satellite imagery suggests that it serves as the administrative headquarters, logistic base, and primary housing area for the facilities associated with the Taehung Youth Hero Mine. The largest rail yard along the Tanchon-Muhak-tong rail line and an electrical substation are located here.While available imagery from 2012-2017 is limited, it can be observed that portions of Taehung-ni were damage or destroyed in the 2012 flood. By 2017, the damage was repaired and the village slightly enlarged. At the rail yard on the north side, the size of tailings pile had expand by approximately 30 percent by the end of 2017. Whether this is because of changes in the sequence of ore processing or a result of the international sanctions imposed during 2016, and more significantly 2017, is unknown.\n\n               The center of Taehung-ni, September 30, 2006.

(Copyright 2019 by Maxar Technologies)\n             Approximately 3.5 kilometers north of Taehung-ni on the east side of the Puktae-chon at Yangchon-dong are the main processing facilities for the Taehung Youth Hero Mine. Open source reports indicate that these consist of the Taehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory, Light-burned Magnesia Factory, Briquette Factory, several unidentified processing facilities, storage silos, a railyard, rail loading\/unloading facilities, and several unidentified support facilities. South Korean sources estimate that the Taehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory has a designed total processing capacity of 600,000 tons per annum of magnesite ore.26As with the village of Taehung-ni, the 2012 flood reportedly caused significant damage to the processing facilities at Yangchon-ni. According to North Korean statements this damaged was repaired during 2013-2014, although there are hints in later reports that some repairs have not yet been completed or that a decision had been made to simply leave some of the damage unaddressed. While available imagery between 2012-2017 is lacking, an image acquired in 2018 indicates that minor razing and construction activity had taken place since 2012. While most of this activity was undoubtedly in response to flood damage, it is unknown if its scale is attributable to international sanctions imposed during 2016 and 2017.\n\n The Taehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory and other processing plants at Yangchon-dong, April 30, 2004.

Much of this was repaired by 2015. What impact this had upon the mining infrastructure is unknown but North Korean reports indicate that the Muhak-tong Branch Mine, and likely the Muhak-tong ore processing and loading facility, were temporarily shut down. Similar reports indicate that all these facilities were operational, to some degree, by the end of 2013. Limited satellite imagery between 2015-2019 shows that the ore pile at the Muhak-tong ore processing and loading facility appears to have increased slightly.Located 700 meters west of the Muhak-tong ore processing facility is a small unidentified processing plant.

(Copyright 2019 by Maxar Technologies)\n             Located on the southern hill mass above Puktuilryong (Puktuil Pass) and the Puktae-chon Valley is the Puktu-dong Branch Mine - more commonly referred to as the Taehung Youth Hero Mine. Examination of satellite imagery indicates that it is a large-scale active surface mining operation that encompasses the villages of Puktu-dong, Sirubongdogi, Hakkyo-maul, a large surface mine, and several smaller surface mining activities (most of which appear abandoned). The village of Puktu-dong provides housing and support to the workers at the mine and appears to be the mine's headquarters and logistics base. Sirubongdogi provides additional housing, and Hakkyo-maul appears to provide additional support. The main surface mine encompasses approximately 1.2 square kilometers, the vast majority of which is covered with tailings from the mine. At the center is a rock crusher with a conveyor belt system. Distributed around the mine and identifiable in satellite imagery are the mine headquarters and engineer offices, a gantry crane (for repairing heavy equipment), a vehicle maintenance and storage facility, an electricity substation, several smaller support buildings, and a number of housing areas.\n\n     Overview image of the area containing the Taehung Youth Hero Mine, Mutak-dong Branch Mine, and the surrounding ore processing mining facilities, July 6, 2019.

(Copyright 2019 by Maxar Technologies)\n             Open source reports state that the ore extracted here is sent by rail to the Taehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory and other processing facilities at Yangchon-dong. From there it is shipped by rail to Tanchon, where it is further processed at the Tanchon Magnesia Factory. It is then shipped by rail to the Songjin Refractory Plant in Kimchaek-si, Hambuk and elsewhere in the country, shipped by rail or sea to China, or shipped by sea in bulk carriers to foreign customers (see below).27Available satellite imagery of the Taehung Youth Hero Mine and supporting activities at Sirubongdogi and Hakkyo-maul between from 2010-2018 is limited. While North Korean reports state that the mine was temporarily shut down as a result of the 2012 Typhoon Bolaven (Typhoon-15) it is unclear whether this was due to damage to the open pit mine itself or, more probably, to the railroad, roads, and processing facilities at Taehung-ni, Yangchon-dong, or Muhak-tong in the valley below. Regardless, similar reports indicate that the mine was fully operational by the end of 2013. Imagery from 2018 and 2019 shows that changes had occurred over the intervening years such as increasing footprints of tailings piles, shifting excavation activity, minor additions to small structures, razing of other structures, etc. This activity appears consistent with what would be expected from an open pit mine of this size in rural North Korea. At present, none of these changes can be specifically attributed to Typhoon Bolaven or to the imposition of international sanctions during 2016 and 2017.\n \n      Overview of the Puktu-dong area and abandoned surface mining activity, Taehung Youth Hero Mine, July 6, 2019.

(Copyright 2019 by Maxar Technologies)\n             Economic Importance Acknowledged by Senior OfficialsThe Taehung Youth Hero Mine is frequently cited as playing a significant role in the nation's economic development. Kim Jong-il and senior officials have visited the mine on a number of occasions and provided on-the-spot guidance or field guidance. During his 2009 visit to the mine, Kim Jong-il applauded the role of the mine in advancing North Korea's industrial development and the \"Juche-ification\" of the people's economy.28 During 2012, North Korean sources claimed that the Taehung Youth Hero Mine \"boasts of billions of tons of [magnesite] deposits, which account for over 25 percent of the world's magnesite deposits.\"29 It reportedly was assigned an important role in North Korea's implementation of the \"five-year plan for national economic development\" announced in 2016.30While it is likely that Kim Il-sung also visited the mine during one of his inspection trips to Hamnam, no readily available information is available concerning any such visits. There are no readily available reports of Kim Jong-un visiting the mine since his assumption of power in 2011. While the attached timeline is not a complete listing of all senior leadership visits to the Taehung Youth Hero Mine, it provides an indication of its importance to the nation's senior leadership.Engineering and University Research at the Taehung Youth Hero MineResearchers and engineers from the Taehung Youth Hero Mine are reported to be actively conducting research into a wide range of fields that have direct application to the mining sector, indicated by academic papers and reports published during the past 15 years.31 There is a report of a Taehung Industrial University that apparently undertakes mine-related research and education of workers and staff for the mines in the Taehung-ni area. Given its name and association with the Taehung Youth Hero Mine, it is likely that it is located in Taehung-ni. It is common practice in North Korea to have small industry-specific universities and schools co-located with large industrial complexes.North Korean sources have frequently mentioned that research conducted at the Taehung Youth Hero Mine has led to the introduction of new mining methods to increase mineral output at the mine. For example, in 2017, Uriminzokkiri reported the introduction of a new \"combined circular open-air - underground mining method\" to create a \"short-cut\" to mine development. This new mining method was reportedly an \"innovative plan to break the established theories of the world's mining system\" which stated that \"the maximum marginal tilt-angle of the open-air mining site cannot exceed 45 degrees to bravely set the marginal tilt-angle to 57 degrees\" in order to expand production capabilities while keeping production costs low. In a June 2019 article regarding the Taehung Youth Hero Mine, Ryomyong reported that rather than discarding powdered ore produced in the magnesite production process, the powder ore is now being converted into lumps of ore to be reused for the production of light-burned magnesia and magnesia clinkers. According to this report, 1,000 tons of reusable ore have already been produced.Several universities and industrial establishments have been mentioned in connection to supporting the operations at the Taehung Youth Hero Mine. For example, during 2011 researchers at the Pyongyang University of Light Industry contributed to the construction of anthracite briquette bonding agents, which are used for the production of magnesia clinker.32 During 2015 researchers at the Taehung Industrial University were reported to be undertaking a research project to determine a reasonable ventilation and wind pressure system in order to conserve electricity. The following year, scientists from the University of Natural Science, including the head of the chemistry department, Song Hak-chul, reportedly traveled to the Taehung Youth Hero Mine. There, they investigated ways of using phosphorus, which is commonly found in the area, as the raw material for creating a compound bonding agent.\n \n Scientists from the University of Natural Science assisting the Taehung Youth Hero Mine. (DPRK Today, July 14, 2016)\n             Tanchon and Port of TanchonThe port city of Tanchon is home to a number of industrial facilities that directly support the mining activities subordinate to the Tanchon District Mining Bureau.33 Most often cited are the Tanchon Magnesia Clinker Factory and Tanchon Mining Machine Factory.The Tanchon Magnesia Factory is reportedly the largest magnesia manufacturing plant in North Korea, with a designed capacity of 2 million tons of magnesia per annum and is often cited as the nation's powerful refractory producer.34By rail it receives ore extracted not only from the Taehung Youth Hero Mine but also from the Ryongyang Mine and Komdok Mining Complex and clinker products from these mines to produce dozens of kinds of magnesia products, especially magnesia clinker, light burned magnesia, and electrocast magnesia clinker. It also pushes the second- and third-stage processing. Reports also indicate that in association with the Taehung Youth Hero Mine and Ryongyang Mine that the Tanchon Magnesia Factory produces or supplies products to produce:\"chipboard and wainscot on an industrial basis. They continue to develop a variety of fine fixtures and building materials including door, newel, flowerpot, desk, shuttering and prop by raising the quality of slightly burned magnesia chipboard. Among the processed products is the roller for conveyor belt which is made of by-products from the magnesia clinker production process.\"35Other items produced with products from the Tanchon Magnesia Factory reportedly include magnesia cement, light burned magnesia fertilizer, pulp and paper, medicines and cosmetics.36 Magnesia cement is also used in the steel industry and can be used for optical equipment, rocket nozzles, and nuclear reactors.The Tanchon Mining Machine Factory specializes in the production of large machinery and equipment used in the mines, factories, and enterprises in the Tanchon area. This factory appears to be subordinate to the Korea Zinc Industry Group located in Potonggang-guyok, Pyongyang. Among the products it reportedly produces are large ore-dressing machines and parts for pulverizing, sifting and flotation, electric cars, trams and their wheels, belt rolls, blowers, exhausters, reduction gears, compressors, magnesia clinker production facilities, and other mining-related equipment.37\n \nInterior of the Tanchon Mining Machine Factory as seen during 2018.

References \n\n Antiquated facilities, equipment, and processes, together with the continual plague of electricity shortages, will hinder any dramatic production increases of magnesite at North Korea's Taehung Youth Hero Mine.\n\n While the Taehung Youth Hero Mine is ascribed a notable role in North Korea\u2019s economy, reporting indicates sanctions limiting the North's mineral exports continue to affect the magnesite industry by curtailing foreign currency earning and thereby its ability to acquire necessary parts and equipment.\n\n The Taehung Youth Hero Mine \u201chas established the Juche orientation in the production of fireproof materials and this can be called a revolution. It is a great achievement that has brought about an epochal turn in developing our industry. It is as significant as the success in a nuclear test.\u201d \u2014Kim Jong-il, May 20, 2009\n\n Small Infrastructure and Production Improvements, 2017 - 2018 \n\n Small infrastructure and production improvements are reported to have taken place at both the Taehung Youth Hero and Ryongyang mines throughout 2017-2018.  For example, during October 2017 it was reported that technicians and workers \u201cwere accomplishing unprecedented achievements in the increase in production of magnesia clinker and light-burned magnesia. . .. [with 2017 production] increased by 110% and 115%, respectively.\u201d \n\nDuring 2018, a Chinese source stated that the Taehung Youth Hero Mine had \u201ca reserve of 820 million tons (46.77 percent magnesium oxide), and an annual production capacity of 1 million tons of raw ore. . .. [And] in 2007 [before the 2012 flood], the Taehung Mine had an output of 400,000 tons of magnesite concentrate, a very poor output compared to their production capacity.\u201d  It is unclear if the authors of this report believed that production output had now returned to that level. A May 2018 South Korean report placed the magnesite reserves at the Taehung Youth Hero Mine at 640 million tons. \n\n Recovery and Reconstruction, 2012 - 2016\n\n North Korean media reports that relief and repair efforts began almost immediately. Major repair efforts continued through at least the end of the year. During October, it was reported that the Taehung Youth Hero Mine had resumed the briquettes production process and that the mine itself had \u201crestarted production.\u201d  Whether this referred to briquette production or magnesite production is unclear. By the end of November, it was reported that many roads had been rebuilt, the rail line between Kumgol to Tasin (halfway to Muhak-tong) was at least minimally operational (e.g., fortified roadbeds, replaced rails and sleepers, and rebuilt revetments and rail bridges), work on building new housing for workers was proceeding rapidly, and that the \u201cfinal stage project\u201d had begun.  North Korean statements at the end of October that the Taehung Youth Hero, Ryongyang, and Komdok mines had \u201centered into the normal production\u201d are clearly false.  Minor repairs at all these facilities and their support infrastructure continued well into 2013, as indicated by a June 2013 \u201cfield survey\u201d of the region by Premier Pak Pong Ju. During this visit Pak \u201cdiscussed the matters of radically increasing the production at the Taehung Youth Hero Mine and other mines and industrial establishments.\u201d  He also emphasized the \u201cimportance of keeping the equipment in full-capacity operation and putting them on a modern basis. . .. [And] underscored the need for the ministries, national institutions and other relevant units to supply a sufficient quantity of raw and other materials and took measures for preventing the damage in rainy seasons.\u201d \n\nRestoration of an acceptable production capacity likely took several years, as indicated by the production output noted in the Mineral Commodity Summaries for 2013-2015. \n\nContinuing to emphasize the importance that Kim Jong-il placed upon industrial production in Hamnam during 2015, he reportedly made inspection visits to the province on a monthly basis that included the \u201cTaehung Youth Hero Mine, Komdok Mining Complex, Ryongyang Mine and other mines.\u201d  Here he praised the \u201cTaehung Youth Hero Mine and Tanchon Magnesia Factory [Tanchon Magnesia Clinker Factory]\u201d for \u201cmaking magnesia clinker industry Juche-based.\u201d  It is likely that the Taehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory was included within this broad praise. By early 2016, DPRK media was reporting that the \u201cTaehung Youth Hero Mine and Ryongyang and Paekbawi mines were now daily producing several hundred more tons of magnesite than scheduled.\u201d  \n\n Typhoon Bolaven Causes Major Damage\n\n Operations at the Taehung Youth Hero, Ryongyang, and Komdok mines were severely disrupted during August 2012 when Typhoon Bolaven (known locally as Typhoon-15) made landfall in North Korea.  The damage caused by flooding and mud slides was extensive. Korean People\u2019s Army (KPA) troops were brought into the area to assist with the restoration of the mines and their supporting facilities.  Major damage was reported at the Taehung Youth Hero Mine and its associated facilities:\n\u2022\tBetween Tanchon and Kumgol, roads were washed away in more than 870 sections, and railway beds, iron bridges, and rails were flooded, buried by mud, or simply washed away.\n\u2022\tThe rail line from Kumgol to Muhag was likewise severely damaged.\n\u2022\tA \u201cbranch factory disappeared\u201d and only \u201cskeletons\u201d of several light burning kilns remained.\n\u2022\tLarge quantities of equipment, including excavators and large blowers and pipes, were washed away, buried, or destroyed.\n\u2022\tAt least 120 pieces of other equipment, including electric motors and winches, were destroyed.\n\u2022\tCommunication networks and power lines were cut off or washed away.\n\u2022\tMore than 2,000 cubic meters of muck and mud had to be cleared from production buildings and drainage canals.\n\u2022\tOver 500 dwellings were destroyed.\n\nThe net result was that both the Taehung Youth Hero Mine, as well as the Ryongyang and Komdok mines, ceased to operate. \n\n High-level Visits Increase Attention to Production Levels, 2011 - 2012 \n\n During October 2011, Kim Jong-il provided field guidance to a number of industrial facilities in the northeast sections of the country, including the Taehung Youth Hero and Ryongyang mines. Here he made several important policy speeches that restated the importance of magnesite and the Taehung Youth Hero Mine to the national economy declaring: \u201cthe Taehung Youth Hero Mine is of weighty importance in the nation\u2019s economy and the improvement of the standard of the people\u2019s living it is necessary to steadily increase the production of minerals and further raise the quality of magnesia products.\u201d \n\nHe also praised the mine for instituting a number of industrial developments including: \u201csharply decreasing earth-scraping by introducing a new open-air mining method of Korean style . . . technological progress in the drive for producing light burned second processing goods by a physical method . . . significantly cutting down production cost . . . [and] producing alcohol by use of sawdust and making quality bond from its by-product for using it for the molding of anthracitic oval briquette.\u201d  \n\nFinally, in a symbolic gesture, he met with \u201cPyongyang Girls\u201d (now women) who had \u201cvolunteered to work at the mine\u201d more than two decades ago.  Other reports from Kim\u2019s field guidance state that at this time the Taehung Youth Hero Mine \u201chas reached a record high in ore production by employing a new open cast mining method.\u201d \n\nReinforcing Kim\u2019s visit, during November 10-11, Premier Choe Yong Rim visited the Tanchon District Mining Bureau, Taehung Youth Hero Mine, Ryongyang Mine, Tanchon Magnesia Factory, and Tanchon Smeltery. He provided \u201con-the-spot\u201d guidance into the \u201cprocessing of all ores and full and timely supply of necessary materials and goods of cooperative.\u201d  The reference to \u201ctimely supply of necessary materials and goods\u201d is noteworthy as it implies there were issues in these areas impacting production despite North Korea propaganda statements.\n\nA year-end report on economic achievements during 2011 also indicated that the Taehung Youth Hero Mine (mores specifically the Taehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory) had begun \u201cproducing magnesia clinker and light burned magnesia with locally available fuel, instead of cokes.\u201d  Regardless, that the Taehung Youth Hero Mine was still struggling to meet production output goals appears to be verified by a June 1, 2012 report that, \u201cEmployees of the Taehung Youth Hero Mine in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea have been making big efforts to boost mineral output and further upgrade the quality of processed magnesia.\u201d \n\n Visit by Kim Jong-il, May 21, 2009 \n\n Highlighting the importance of the Taehung Youth Mine to the national economy on May 21, 2009, Kim Jong-il visited the facility. Here he reportedly observed a recently completed \u201cmagnesia clinker production line\u201d (undoubtedly at the Taehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory) and stated that the mine had \u201cestablished the Juche orientation in the production of fireproof materials and this can be called a revolution. It is a great achievement that has brought about an epochal turn in developing our industry.\u201d Then he declared that the designers, technicians, and workers who had been involved in the production of \u201cfireproof materials were all heroes\u201d and declared that the \u201cTaehung Youth Mine should be renamed Taehung Youth Hero Mine.\u201d \n\nA KCNA report from August 2009 declared that the \u201cTaehung Youth Hero Mine . . . can produce several million tons of magnesite ore in a chute.\u201d  While this may be theoretically correct, two months later, the South Korean Ministry of Unification issued a report \u201cciting the 2007 on-spot surveys . . . [that] the Komdok Mining Complex and the Taehung Youth Hero Mine in the country\u2019s north have vast deposits of lead, zinc and magnesite, but their dilapidated infrastructure requires renovations for full-scale exploration.\u201d  These surveys were undertaken as part of an inter-Korean agreement to jointly develop North Korean natural resources, signed during a period of rapprochement between the North and South.  This agreement would, however, collapse during April 2011.  Some South Korean industry sources expressed frustration and concern because during the previous five years (2006-2010) North Korean minerals purchases by China had risen by more than threefold and evidence mounted that the Chinese government was \u201choarding\u201d North Korean mineral resources through expanded infrastructure cooperation with North Korea.  The following month KCNA announced that during the first four months of 2011 \u201cmagnesia clinker production has increased 1.2 times compared with the corresponding period of last year. . . . [and] the Taehung Youth Hero Mine and the Ryongyang Mine have reconditioned kilns for increased production.\u201d  This increased magnesia clinker production was a reference to the Taehung Magnesia Clinker Branch Factory.\n\n Production Recovery, 1997-2007\n\n By 1997, the conditions of the \u201cArduous March\u201d\u2014a period of mass starvation from 1994-1998\u2014began to abate, and during April 1997, the Korean Central Broadcasting Network carried a news segment that announced that the \u201cTaehung Youth Mining Complex workers increase production.\u201d  Although reliable information is lacking, development at the mine was likely reinvigorated sometime between 1999-2003 as national resources could once again be focused upon the development of the chemical, extractive, and rail sectors of the economy.\n\nAvailable information indicates that from 2007 onwards the North Korean leadership has emphasized the importance of the Taehung Youth Hero Mine (and other magnesite mines) and sought to improve the mine\u2019s production output.\n\nA North Korean report from April 2007 states that workers and staff at the Taehung Youth Hero Mine had \u201cfound the way to normalize production,\u201d suggesting that prior to this production output was not consistent.  The root cause(s) for this is unclear but may have been related to lingering effects from the Arduous March and the inability to purchase spare parts and new equipment from foreign suppliers.\n\n Taehung Mining Complex Renamed \n\n According to North Korean propaganda during June 1990, \u201c19 girls of the Songchon-gang Clothing Factory in Hamhung volunteered for work in the Taehung Mining Complex.\u201d Subsequently, after receiving a report concerning their actions, Kim Jong-il praised them, and the mine was renamed the Taehung Youth Mine.  Moving forward, these and other women volunteers at the Taehung Youth Hero and Ryongyang mines would be known as \u201cPyongyang Girls,\u201d and they have been featured in North Korean media as examples to follow.  This employment of North Korean youth at the Taehung Mining Complex was not unusual as it was a component of the larger \u201cYouth Shock Brigade\u201d movement that began in May 1975.\n\n Development and Operations Likely Decline Precipitously, 1990-1997 \n\n Development and operations of the Taehung Youth Hero Mine likely declined precipitously during the 1990s due to the 1994 death of Kim Il-song and the subsequent period of repeated drought, famine and economic collapse\u2014known collectively as the Arduous March. Throughout this period Youth Shock Brigades, their \u201cSpeed Campaigns\u201d and the mass movement of people into the countryside for labor projects in an effort to mitigate the effects of the Arduous March were often credited great construction achievements including with helping to develop the Taehung Youth Hero Mine.  Many of these reported achievements, however, were without merit as those involved in the projects were unskilled and malnourished. \n\n Early Development of the Teahung Mine, 1971\n\n North Korean media reports during the 2000s frequently state that the Taehung mine was developed in the 1980s, however, similar sources from the 1990s state that the mine \u201cwas developed in the 1970s.\u201d  While either period could be correct, a declassified CIA KH-4B satellite imagery from April 1, 1971 shows no indication of significant magnesite mining activity or of the infrastructure to support it in the Taehung, Yangchon-dong, Muhak-tong, or Puktu-dong areas.  Like the Ryongyang Mine, the Taehung Youth Hero Mine was organized under the Korea Magnesia Clinker Industry Group located in Potonggang-guyok, Pyongyang. \n\nLittle reliable detailed open-source information is readily available concerning the development or operations of the Taehung Youth Hero Mine from the mid-1970s through the late-1980s. It is obvious that the electrified railroad was extended from Kumgol through Taehung-ni, Yangchon-dong, and ultimately to Muhak-tong. Concurrently, housing was built at these locations, a magnesia clinker branch factory and other ore processing facilities were constructed at Yangchon-dong and Muhak-tong, the open pit mine at Puktu-dong and underground mine at Muhak-tong began operations, and other utilities (e.g., electricity and telephone) and support services were put in place.","authors":["Joseph Bermudez","Marie DuMond"],"categories":["North Korea's Economy"],"tags":["csis","economy","mine","mining","rare-earth"],"url":"http:\/\/www.tearline.mil\/public_page\/mining-north-korea-magnesite-production-at-the-taehung-youth-hero-mine\/","id":null}
{"title":"Across the Tracks: North Korean Railcar Manufacturing and the 2018 Inter-Korean Agreement","body":null,"content":"North Korea's railroad system, with over 7,400 kilometers (km) of track, is critical both to the North Korean economy and national defense, serving as the primary means for long-haul cargo and passenger transportation.1 Chongjin city, the largest city by square kilometers outside North Korea's capital, is a key part of this system as the most significant hub on the North Korea section of the freight rail line connecting Beijing, China, and Khasan, Russia, and one of a handful larger hubs in the domestic railway network. Most significantly, Chongjin is also home to North Korea's second-most active trading port, accounting for 24.2 percent of the country's import\/export activity in general cargo, agricultural goods, coal, and steel. The Chongjin port has a handling capacity of approximately 8 million tons, second only to that of Nampho in the southwest.2 It boasts the second-greatest length of dock space usable by commercial shipping in the country at approximately 2,888 meters.The railway factory located in Chongjin, therefore, plays a relatively unassuming, yet vital connecting role in the regional and national economies. As efforts progress to modernize and reconnect the eastern transportation corridor between North and South Korea under the April 27 Panmunjeom Declaration, the railcars produced and serviced at the Chongjin Railway Factory could play an increasingly important role. The Chongjin Railway Factory is one of just five major industrial facilities that undertake railcar production and depot-level repairs for the nationwide network. It is primarily engaged in the manufacture, repair, and scrap of railcars. Some small parts are likely manufactured within the factory, while others are scavenged from scrapped railcars or procured from local light industries. While the factory is active, commercial satellite imagery shows this activity is at a lower-than-anticipated level for a facility of this size and layout, suggesting shortages of raw material, energy, financial resources, administrative malaise, economic limitations, or any combination of these.\n\n The Chongjin Railway Factory (41.793718 129.796317) is located in the eastern section of Chongjin city and adjacent to the Chongjin Chongnyon Rail Station. As of February 2018, the Chongjin Railway Factory is an active repair and production facility and is being maintained at a reasonable level by North Korean standards. While there are approximately 140 railcars of various types present in the railyard, there are no visible indications of any significant new railcar production. This activity, however, could easily be missed if it is undertaken at a low level.There are no readily available reports of Kim Jong-un visiting the factory since he came to power. However, attesting to the facility's historical importance to the economy, a number of reported high-level visits to the factory have been undertaken by Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and other senior officials over the years. Furthermore, railcar manufacture and repair, as well as the Chongjin Railway Factory itself, have been frequently mentioned in North Korean media.3Despite the importance of railway system and by extension its associated manufacturing facilities, outside knowledge of North Korea's infrastructure is lacking, according to a pilot survey of regional experts conducted by CSIS Beyond Parallel. When experts from the United States, South Korea, Japan, and Russia were polled, approximately 50 percent said they believed there was insufficient or no empirical analysis available on infrastructure. For example, of the South Korean experts surveyed, 46 percent said this of China, 50 percent of Japan, and 71 percent of Russia.\n\n Commercial satellite imagery indicates the primary type of railcars manufactured and serviced at the factory are gondolas and hoppers used primarily to haul mineral ore and coal from mines to heavy industries and powerplants in the province, especially the Songjin Iron and Steel Complex, Sonbong Thermal Powerplant, Kimchaek Iron and Steel Complex, and Chongjin Structural Steel Works. In turn, the Kimchaek Iron and Steel Complex and Chongjin Structural Steel Works provide the finished and semi-finished products to the Chongjin Railway Factory for railcar manufacture and repair.Aside from the movement of rail cars, few external changes of significance have been observed at the factory between 2006 and 2018 with the exception of the replacement of an assembly\/repair hall roof between 2016 and 2017, and the replacement of roofs on a second assembly\/repair hall roof and support building between 2017 and 2018.\n\n With regards to the movement of railcars, those positioned on tracks leading to the main assembly\/repair hall on the east side of the facility exhibit regular changes in numbers and types of railcars present. A number of tracks on the west side of the yard, apparently used to store railcars for scavenging spare parts and eventual scrapping, have railcars that have not moved in years.\n\n The imagery also shows piles of rubbish throughout the facility. However, this is somewhat typical of railroad facilities such as this and should not necessarily be taken as an indicator of level of activity. Obvious in any summer or fall imagery of the factory is that almost all open space at the Chongjin Railway Factory is used for gardening. While such gardening is typical of large industrial facilities in North Korea, the level seen at the Chongjin Railway Factory appears somewhat high which is likely an indicator of a reduced level of railway-related activity.References1.

References  \n\nIf, going forward, the April 27 inter-Korea agreement is substantially executed, Chongjin and its Railway Factory will be an area of focus given its role in the eastern transportation corridor. Furthermore, evidence of high-level visits to the site would be a significant sign of heightened priority being given by North Korean leadership to transportation infrastructure development and improvements.  \n\n Connection and modernization of railways in the Korean peninsula's eastern transportation corridor is a declared step within the historic April 27, 2018 joint declaration for peace, prosperity, and unification. \n\n Chongjin Railway Factory is one of two major railway manufacturing facilities in North Korea's eastern corridor. Analysis of this facility can be a brick-and-mortar sign-post of foundational infrastructure progress if the trust-building project of reconnecting the Koreas' railways is carried out.  \n\n Railway manufacturing facilities have served as a necessary link in North Korea\u2019s underdeveloped economy, presently offer new possibilities in inter-Korean relations, and will be foundational infrastructure for future unification. However, knowledge of North Korea\u2019s infrastructure is lacking according to a pilot survey of regional experts conducted by CSIS Beyond Parallel. The following in-depth study of North Korea\u2019s railcar manufacturing infrastructure seeks to begin to address that void.\n\nWhile the Chongjin Railway Factory is currently active, commercial satellite imagery shows this activity is at a lower-than-anticipated level for a facility of this size and layout, suggesting shortages of raw material, energy, financial resources, administrative malaise, economic limitations, or any combination of these.\n\n Background \n\n The Chongjin Railway Factory is believed to be directly subordinate to the Ministry of Railways and, along with four other major industrial facilities, is responsible for production and depot-level repairs. Chongjin\u2019s four sister facilities are the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex, 6 July Railway Factory, Kim Chong-tae Electric Locomotive Works, and the Pyongyang Rolling Stock Repair Plant.  Reflecting a general geographic division of the nation into east and west coasts caused by several north-south mountain ranges, three of these facilities are a part North Korea\u2019s east coast transportation corridor-- the 6 July Railway Factory in Rahung, the Chongjin Railway Factory, and the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex.\n\nThe Ministry of Railways also exercises control over the rail network including research and development, education and training, security, railroad operations, acquisition and production. Rail operations are conducted by the Korean State Railway through at least six regional bureaus\u2014Chongjin, Hamhung, Kaechon, Pyongyang, Naseon, and Sariwon.  Subordinate to these regional rail bureaus are more than 20 secondary repair shops and 50 engine houses located along the rail network throughout the nation that undertake minor repairs and routine maintenance. While the Chongjin Railway Factory is believed to be directly subordinate to the Ministry of Railways, its location in Chongjin means that it works closely with the Chongjin Railway Bureau and has access to its ancillary facilities such as the Chongjin Railway Bureau Hospital. The factory\u2019s relationship to other railway facilities in the area such as the Chongjin Railway Transport College, Chongjin Railway Special School, and Chongjin Railway Paint Factory is unknown.\n\n Slow Recovery(?), 2000-2004 \n\n By 2000, however, the Chongjin Railway Factory appears to have begun slowly recovering and was reported to be repairing \u201ctrains using innovating technology.\u201d  It was apparently also diversifying as a report from August 2000 states that the factory was now also repairing tractors.  While this may have been a reflection of the expanding practice for industrial facilities to undertake work outside their normal area of operations, it appears to be more an indication that the factory was still facing significant challenges in procuring raw materials (for railcar production). This assertion appears supported by a nationwide campaign that year to collect scrap iron for use in steel mills. The Ministry of Railways was responsible for transporting the collected scrap iron to the steel mills and claimed great success in doing so.  In December 2000, the Korean Central Broadcasting System reported that the Chongjin Railway Factory had \u201cachieved its annual plans.\u201d  These claims on the surface, however, appear difficult to accept.\n\nThroughout 2001 there were reports that the Chongjin Railway Factory was accelerating the repair of freight cars and had been one of 92 industrial enterprises granted awards for their achievements.  Such reports continued throughout 2003 and 2004. \n\n Economic collapse, 1991-1998 \n\n The Arduous March, the prolonged period of dramatic droughts and floods resulting in nationwide famine following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and generally agreed to have ended in 1998 with its effects lasting into the 2000s, caused dramatic disruption in the symbiotic relationship between the production of iron and steel and the railroad network, as the former was not able to produce iron and steel without the raw materials provided by the latter. Railroad infrastructure faced its own challenges and was not able to provide the ore and coal without the steel and iron needed for rails, railcar production, and repairs. Additionally, Kimchaek Iron and Steel Complex and Chongjin Structural Steel Works either operated irregularly or suspended operations for long periods. \n\nWhile there was little North Korean reporting on the Chongjin Railway Factory or railcar production and repair during the Arduous March, it may be deduced that the period had resulted in the dramatic curtailment, if not suspension, of railcar manufacture at the factory. During a May 1999 conference on the need for increased iron, steel, and mine production in North Hamgyong Province, it was announced that \u201cComrade Kim Jong-il, the great leader of our party and our people, sent rolling stocks to the Chongjin Railway Bureau.\u201d  Had the Chongjin Railway Factory been operating effectively at this time there would have been no need to do so. \n\n From the War Years to Strategic Direction, 1950-1977 \n\n During the Korean War, the city of Chongjin, including the railroad workshops, was heavily damaged by United Nations Command air strikes.  With the signing of the Armistice Agreement in 1953 North Korea undertook reconstruction efforts with assistance from China, the Soviet Union, and other communist countries.  One of the first areas for reconstruction was the rail network throughout the nation.  As with the other major rail facilities the Chongjin railroad workshops were rebuilt with machine tools and equipment imported from China, the Soviet Union, and Poland. \n\nIt is presently unclear both when the railroad shops at Chongjin were officially renamed the Chongjin Railway Factory and when the facility was expanded to allow for the serial production of railcars.  Declassified satellite imagery from January 1976, however, shows a facility that differs little in size and composition from that seen on the U.S.  Army\u2019s 1946 city map.  This suggests that the formal establishment of the factory may have occurred sometime after the Supreme People's Assembly held in December 1977 when Kim Il-sung established strategic direction and guidelines for railway development and railcar production.  \n\n Chongjin's First Significant Railroad Activity, 1910-1945 \n\n The first significant railroad activity in the Chongjin area occurred during the colonial period as part of a broader Japanese effort to construct a rail network throughout Korea.  Track was laid connecting Hoeryong in the north through Chongjin to Wonsan in the south.\n\nWithin Chongjin railroad, facilities were constructed to support this rail line and service the port facilities, nearby mines, and later the Seishin Iron and Steel Works, Mitsubishi Iron Works, and other industries. Significant among these facilities were the railroad workshops in the northern section of the city.\n\nDuring the immediate post-World War II period the nascent North Korean government took control of the rail network, including the railroad workshops in Chongjin.  The importance of the rail network to the nation at this time is indicated by the story that Kim Jong-suk, an anti-Japanese partisan and Kim Il-sung\u2019s first wife, reportedly visited Chongjin in December 1945 to \"encourage railway workers to take active part in the struggle for building a new country after the country's liberation from Japan's colonial rule.\u201d  Kim Il-sung is reported to have stated during this immediate postwar period:\n\n \"In order to build a new Korea, we must reconstruct the destroyed industry as soon as possible and create a prosperous economy.  For that purpose, we must first normalize transportation by restoring railways as the country's artery. ...The running of railways is the equivalent to the circulation of blood in a human body.\" ","authors":["Joseph Bermudez","Victor Cha","Marie DuMond"],"categories":["North Korea's Economy"],"tags":["chongjin","csis","economy","infrastructure","rail","transportation","unification"],"url":"http:\/\/www.tearline.mil\/public_page\/across-the-tracks-north-koreas-railcar-manufacturing-and-the-2018-inter-korean-agreement\/","id":null}
