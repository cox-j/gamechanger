Based on this initial look at the DPRK's coal industry, all signs appear to reflect the impact of the UN sanctions on the country, but also hint at a degree of infractions occurring on the part of the signatories by those closely aligned with North Korea. Activity This report takes a high-level look at two areas of North Korea's coal industry: 1) its mining in the South Pyongan Region, and 2) its rail coal transfer stations located along the Taedong River, which flows through the region. It also examines a few of the key coal ports and the rail transfer yards along the Chinese and Russian borders. Article  Timeline  The August 2017 UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2371 was the most recent resolution passed that placed a number of sanctions against North Korea, probably the most critical of which was against its coal export industry. Rich in a number of natural resources, coal and limestone yield the most in mining tonnage each year, but arguably, coal has provided the greatest source of currency to the economically struggling nation. What imagery reveals about the country's coal production and distribution is an important piece to understanding the state and health of North Korea's coal industry. North Korea is heavily dependent on its natural resources for both its domestic energy production and trade for foreign currency. Of its many resources, mining plays a critical role, and coal is the dominant ore in terms of production. For many years, China has been the North's largest foreign consumer, accounting for approximately 40% of the DPRK's coal export market. However, now with a series of UNSC sanctions in place, the market dynamic for this resource has dramatically changed for North Korea. Monitoring North Korea's coal activity requires context and a timeline of key events to understand what is seen on imagery. In 2015, China stopped importing the North's anthracite coal due to its high sulfur content. This was, in part, an effort to help reduce its air pollution levels. Within a few months, however, coal imports began to flow again, but with tighter quality inspections. In 2016, in response to North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile tests, the UNSC passed two resolutions that placed increasing restrictions on the DPRK's coal exports. Resolution 2270 was unanimously passed in March 2016, banning the North's coal export except for livelihood purposes. In November 2016, Resolution 2321 was unanimously passed, reinforcing the export ban and placing strict limits on even the coal exports considered for livelihood purposes. In February 2017, China took the additional step to ban all coal imports from the DPRK through the end of the year. However, in early August 2017, prior to the issuance of Resolution 2371, China had resumed importing North Korean coal and was allowed a buffer period to complete its August transaction before it would begin its adherence to the new resolution. While initially compliant, there have been subsequent reports of sanctions violations by both the Chinese and Russians, as trading companies have sought to circumvent the agreement, accounting for many of the anomalies in the coal flow patterns observed in imagery. However, despite these increasing restrictions on North Korea's coal exports, the country's larger coal mines have remained active from 2015 to 2019 and improvements have been made to its coal supply-chain infrastructure. South Pyongan Coal Region The South Pyongan coal fields are estimated to hold deposits of approximately 1.23 billion tons of anthracite coal. In commercial satellite imagery of the Ryongun-ri, Ramjo-dong, and Namdok mining areas, there is a distinguishable increase in activity between 2015 to the present. Based on the imagery available, there has been notable growth of spoil piles around these mines, indicating active mining processes. There are also growing piles of coal on the ground and trucks seen consistently moving between the mines to rail and transfer stations and depots. Of the ten smaller and six larger mining complexes examined in this region, a number of the larger mines appear to be active while many of the smaller mines have been shut down. Regional Road-to-Rail Transfer Stations The Taedong River and its tributaries wind through the Pyongan region, and rail lines follow along its shores, as the region is mountainous. There are numerous rail stations and coal depots along its length, most with direct access to the mine complexes located in the adjoining valleys. This report focuses on six observed in imagery over the period from 2015 to the present: Myonghak Station, Pongchang Station (near the Bukchang Concentration Camp), Oidong Station, Tukjang Station, Ryongmun Coal Mine Station, Sokan Station and an unnamed rail transfer station (39.55248, 126.05946) near the Oidong Station. Others, such as the Namdok Loading Depot, while large, had inadequate imagery coverage for a studied look. The general trend for all has been an overall increase in stocks at each location, growing from 2015 to the present. Interestingly, despite 2017 being a tumultuous period for coal exports, no major observable decreases were observed. Of course, it is possible that movement had decreased, but the coal already stockpiled simply remained with no additional ore coming in. Coal Ports and Border Rail Classification Yards Export activity can be observed at both large and small coal ports. To a lesser extent, rail classification yards located at or near key border cities can also be used, but trains are more fleeting, and thus the monitoring of coal export volumes is difficult as rail cars, with or without ore loads, are likely to remain in a yard only briefly. The coal ports range in size from Nampo, the largest west coast port servicing the Pyongyang area, located on the mouth of the Taedong River, to Rajin, a medium-sized port, located on the east coast near the Russian border, to two small ports, the Sunchon Coal Port located northeast of Pyongyang on the Taedong River, and the Ryongchon Coal Port, located at the mouth of the Yalu River south of the Chinese city of Dandong. This report focuses on the smaller, regional coal ports. The other ports and the rail classification yards found along North Korea's borders will be addressed in later reports. Sunchon Coal Port Located on the Taedong River, the coal port is relatively new. Imagery taken in March 2015 revealed empty land along the river. By July 6, 2017, however, construction activity had started on a large quay. By October 23, 2017, the quay had been completed, traveling gantry cranes had been installed, and stores of coal were piled onto it. The port's location suggests that it may have been planned for the movement of coal for internal consumption, albeit, its position on the Taedong River also makes it ideal for moving coal in greater volumes down to Nampo. Ryongchon Coal Port The Ryongchon coal port is located near the mouth of the Yalu River, about 1.6 kilometers downstream from the Chinese city of Dandong. Like Sunchon, the port construction began in 2015 with the clearing of the area for a quay and other port facilities. Coverage was minimal, until March 2017, when the quay was observed to be complete, concrete was being poured for the deck area, and a long, 14-bay storage facility was under construction. By February 17, 2018, the building was completed, three small piles of coal were on the quay, and cargo trucks were queued just outside the security point on the road leading into the facilities. The coal stores are not as large as many of the other facilities and it is unclear why that is the case. The proximity to China facilitates potential short transfers across the river,which may be hard to detect. Furthermore, a couple of kilometers south, there is a sizable, covered rail-to-road transfer station. Ore cars have been observed there, but none have been seen loading or unloading ore. Given these conditions, the coal port and transfer facility merit further monitoring. Conclusion Overall, increasing restrictions on North Korea's coal export industry have not caused mining or supply-chain infrastructure development to collapse. While the country has traditionally valued coal more as a trading commodity than a source for domestic power production, Kim Jong Un did instruct in his 2019 New Year's address that coal should be redirected into the domestic market to better meet the country's energy needs and work toward energy self-sufficiency. Still, efforts to circumvent sanctions, especially on coal exports, are likely to persist, and thus monitoring the coal industry and its supply-chain infrastructure and activities must continue.

This article analyzes the shortcomings China has yet to overcome in upholding its commitment to environmental standards within its SEZ in Zambia\u2019s mining sector.  Activity GEOINT proves especially valuable in our analysis of this Zambia-based Chinese zone because of the visible environmental impact of the mining industry. We identify both the size of China\u2019s mining operation and their attempts at waste management. Article  Timeline  Graphs  Overview In the past decade, China has emerged as a leader in the global effort to establish environmentally-conscious practices to combat climate change: carbon intensity has been reduced, environmental regulations have been instituted, and enforcement strengthened. In addition to the national prioritization of a green transition, China formalized and accelerated its deployment of special economic zones overseas in 2006 when Chinese corporate law was expanded to include social responsibility standards for overseas investment, including those in special economic zones. Building upon this, in 2007 China's Ministry of Commerce also issued a commercial information circular on enhancing environmental surveillance on exporting enterprises with the aim of restricting companies that do not adhere to corporate social responsibility standards from conducting foreign trade.1 Nevertheless, China's investments in the ZCCZ have been plagued by environmental violations, accidents, and criticism by NGOs. This SEZ underscores the challenges that China still faces, even after 15 years after its commitment, in aligning its environmental footprint overseas to the sustainability priority within its own borders. Background The Zambia-China Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone (ZCCZ) was established in 2007 under the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) framework that was created to promote Sino-African relations and economic development.2 Zambia had just introduced Multi-Facility Economic Zones (MFEZs) a year prior in 2006, under the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA) Act No. 11 which laid out the legal framework for free trade zones, export processing zones and industrial parks. As Africa's first special economic zone and China's first major commitment in its pledge to establish special economic zones in Africa by former Chinese president Hu Jintao, the ZCCZ is significant in the history of China's diplomacy, overseas direct investment and foreign economic development. Though formally recognized by China's Ministry of Commerce in 2006, China's state-owned mining enterprise, China Non-Ferrous Metal Mining Company (CNMC) approached Zambia's government earlier in 2004 with a proposal for an industrial park. The ZCCZ is comprised of two sub-zones, the Chambishi MFEZ and the Lusaka East MFEZ. The zone was initially established as the Chambishi MFEZ in 2007 and was extended in 2010 to include the Lusaka East MFEZ. The Chambishi MFEZ is located in Chambishi Township in Zambia's Copperbelt and covers an area of 1,158 hectares. The Chambishi MFEZ primarily supports copper and non-ferrous metal processing industries.3 Chambishi MFEZ, Zambia  The Lusaka East MFEZ is situated 2km adjacent to the Lusaka International Airport and covers an area of 570 hectares. The zone aims to attract investment in processing, manufacturing, light industries, logistics, and real estate. Lusaka's development was established to diversify its resource-intensive investment as well as to accommodate the Zambian government's desire for urban employment opportunities. The ZCCZ is developed and managed by the Chinese state-owned China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group (CNMC) through its Zambian subsidiary, ZCCZ Development Limited. The ZCCZ is responsible for developing the zone, which includes general planning, coordinating on-site construction, as well as liaising with and providing quarterly reports to the Zambia Development Agency, the government body responsible for oversight of all MFEZs. Incentive policies to be implemented inside the ZCCZ were negotiated by CNMC and the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA), the Zambian Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Finance using the 2006 MFEZ Act as the guiding framework and include: Exemption from tax on dividends for five years from the year of first declaration of dividends; 0% corporate tax for five years from the first year profits are made, with 50% of profit to be taxed in years six to eight, increasing to 75% in years nine to ten; 0% import duty rate on raw materials, capital goods, and machinery for five years; and deferment of VAT on machinery and equipment imports.4 Per Zambian SEZ law, the developer is responsible for providing the on-site infrastructure including roads, telecommunications, electricity, water supply, and facilities for administration, training, and commerce. Environmental Analysis Despite being in operation for over a decade, the Chambishi MFEZ does not operate at the same standard for environmental sustainability as domestic Chinese mining zones and has made little progress in implementing comparable practices. While China does not legally require SEZs to meet domestic quality standards, it requires that at a minimum, SEZs follow the environmental laws of the host country. In addition, the Ministry of Commerce issued guidance in 2014 encouraging enterprises to research environmental strategies to strive \"to meet international standards.\" The Chambishi zone, which houses the Chambishi Copper Mine, the Chambishi Smelter, South-East Body, and Main-West Body ores, exhibited poor performance across all our land, water, air, and waste indicators. According to a World Bank-commissioned report as part of the Mining and Environment Remediation and Improvement Project (MERIP), major sources of air pollution on the Copperbelt are smelters, acid plants, and refineries, mining and quarrying, and construction. More specifically, smelters at Chambishi, along with and neighboring facilities were responsible for emitting sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), particulate matter, carbon monoxide (CO), dust, carbon dioxide, offensive odors, and black smoke.5 In mining, waste disposal is a major challenge as it entails building a soil-filled embankment, or a tailings dam, that contains harmful substances that pose health risks to nearby settlements and the environment. The Musakashi reservoir dam is one of the designated waste sites for the Chambishi mines. Despite being aware of the Musakashi Tailings Dam being at maximum capacity for waste disposal in 2011, Nonferrous China Africa Mining (NFCA), a subsidiary of CNMC, continued expanding mining operations within the Chambishi MFEZ. Musakashi Tailings Dam, Chambishi, Zambia  Rather than building a new tailings dam, NFCA heightened the Musakashi Tailings Dam by four meters, increasing the reservoir volume by 5.7 million cubic meters. Stated explicitly in its annual report, NFCA noted this development did not fully meet the safety and environmental protection requirements for tailings discharge, but still offered a safer living environment for downstream residents and guaranteed sustainable development and improvement of the ecological environment.6 Tailings dam extension, Chambishi, Zambia  Unlike the tailings dam adjacent to the Chambishi-West mine that houses its own water treatment plant, the Musakashi tailings dam feeds directly into the Musakashi Stream and into the Kafue River. It was not until a lawsuit was waged by local farmers against NFCA that the company took meaningful change to improve its waste management practices. A Zambian court concluded NFCA's Musakashi Tailings Dam was responsible for polluting the Musakashi stream, damaging crops and neighboring settlements due to NFCA's failure to contain waste.7 After NFCA was found liable, NFCA proposed constructing a new embankment as an addition to the Musakashi Tailings Dam located 5 kilometers downstream of the present wall to dispose of spillover tailings.8 The extension was intended to increase the dam storage capacity to 42 million tons of tailings. In a sign of progress, the new waste storage facility was completed in 2018, as planned.9 Though the expansion was an improvement, the tailings dam does not adhere to the proximity regulations set by ZEMA which state residential areas must not be within 500 meters of tailings facilities.10 As mining operations continue to ramp within the Chambishi MFEZ, tailings storage dam construction has also increased to accommodate the additional waste. While this shows proactive steps to adapt to growing waste management needs, there has not been equal progress to upgrade or expand current water treatment facilities to the same degree. As stated in Zambia's 2006 ZDA law, CNMC is responsible for this infrastructure as the developer of the site. Tailings Dam 15 extension, Chambishi, Zambia  The Chambishi MFEZ also comprises an area of the Copperbelt that has been affected by air and water pollution, soil erosion, acid rain, and crop degradation. In its 2013 report, Citizens for Better Environment, a local NGO, admonished NFCA and Chambishi Copper Smelter (CCS), for failing to comply with local environmental laws, including the submission of emissions certifications and environmental impact reports. Soon after, the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) ordered the Chambishi Copper Smelter (CCS) to shut down its plant.11 Similarly, in 2014, ZEMA ordered a unit of CNMC to halt development on the Chambishi South East Ore project, claiming the company disregarded environmental laws.12 ZEMAs audit report revealed that Chambishi Copper Smelter did not assess the dust parameters, report arsenic, SO2, or other gaseous pollutants, contrary to the air pollution regulations and licensing conditions set by the regulator. The Auditor General in 2014 also revealed that most of the effluents discharged from the mines were above the acceptable limit of the Zambia Environmental Agency for heavy metals.13 While ZEMAs suspensions were temporary, they did result in changes at both mining facilities within the MFEZ. CCS hired Citizens for Better Environment to monitor its emission levels and report them to ZEMA while NFCA developed a government-approved program to compensate communities whose lands were affected by mining activities. Though these remediation efforts are a step forward, it appears that CNMC has yet to execute proactive policies to establish environmental practices. Although advocates continue to call for better environmental compliance, as recently as 2016, Zambia's environmental watchdog launched investigations on seven major mining firms, for discharging effluents into the Mwambashi Stream. The stream is critical as a tributary of the Kafue, the longest river in Zambia and the source of drinking water for Kitwe, the country's second-largest city. Four of the companies' mining operations cited in the investigation were located within the Chambishi MFEZ.14 As a result, the Nkana Water and Sewerage Company was forced to shut down its plant that supplies water to Copperbelt communities.15 In addition, a 2017 study conducted by Copperbelt University found that a borehole adjacent to the Sino-Metals tailings facilities within the Chambishi MFEZ tested positive for groundwater contamination. Groundwater contamination site, Chambishi, Zambia  China's Domestic Mining Standards The Chinese government has accelerated the number and scope of environmental regulations, incentives, and guidelines to enhance sustainability in the mining sector over the past decade. In 2010, the Ministry of Land and Resources launched the green mines standard that outlined the best-in-class environmental and social criteria. The standard addresses the implementation of management systems related to health, safety, and environment, energy efficiency, waste reduction, investment for environmental production, mine site rehabilitation, and engagement in community development.16 In 2014, 661 domestic pilot mines were certified. The project was part of a rigorous restructuring in environmental standards and implementation that ultimately led to the closure of multiple mine sites across China. Additionally, China introduced an environmental tax replacing the pollutant discharge fee and now taxes companies for solid waste, noise, air, and water pollutants. The tax revenue is exclusively used for environmental protection. More recently, the government took steps to close down inefficient, polluting iron ore mines. Iron ore extraction employs similar operations as copper mining. The increased regulation led to 1,000 mining licenses being canceled in 2017.17 In line with its domestic policy, China began making strides in improving governance in projects abroad. The Guidelines for Social Responsibility in Outbound Mining Investments were launched in October 2014 by the China Chamber of Commerce for Minerals, Metals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters (CCCMC), an industry group under the authority of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and are China's first industry codes for mining companies operating abroad.18,19 In an effort to align Chinese companies with other internationally recognized industry standards, the guidelines state Chinese companies: should proactively consider legal, ethical, social, and environmental factors in their decision-making processes and operations. They must thoroughly respect the rights and interests of stakeholders by practicing ethical and transparent behavior and effectively managing the social and environmental impact from mineral exploration, extraction, processing, investment, and related activities and to strive for harmonious mineral development operations. Despite the progress on paper, compliance is voluntary, and the guidelines lack any implementation, enforcement, or accountability mechanisms. While China has instituted frameworks for environmental practices at home, there is insufficient evidence in either satellite imagery analysis or environmental reports by ZEMA or NGOs, to indicate mining operations within the Chambishi MFEZ adhere to the same standards China believes to be appropriate for domestic mining projects. Conclusion China now has decades of experience developing its domestic mineral resource sector, and therefore has a possible basis for holding Chinese mining operations overseas to account. Although the implementation of environmental regulation in China has only become a national priority in recent years, the developed nature of domestic regulations could be used as a minimum standard for companies operating overseas. As China continues to export its development model abroad through the Belt and Road Initiative, taking a proactive role in also exporting its environmental standards is critical. Though host countries may lack a robust regulatory and legal environment to enforce best-practices, Chinese SEZs may have political and economic influence to promote sustainable investment.

Over the next 18 years, Baykar Technologies transformed into Turkey\u2019s top defense exporter and one of the world\u2019s most successful manufacturers of Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAV). The company has become a source of national pride within Turkey, while western governments have expressed concern over what they perceive to be its unchecked proliferation of advanced weapons. The infrastructure that supports Baykar\u2019s operations has hitherto been relatively unexamined in English-language scholarship. This report aims to analyze the company\u2019s capabilities using open sources and commercially available satellite imagery. This part will identify the key facilities associated with Baykar, explore how they have changed over time, define characteristic geospatial aspects, and extrapolate potential future developments. Part II will analyze the critical activities that occur at these facilities and establish a baseline of knowledge about Baykar\u2019s operational model. Key Intelligence Questions 1. What facilities are used for UCAV R&D, production, crew training, systems testing, and product delivery?\n2. To what extent has Baykar's infrastructure expanded since it entered the UAV market in 2004?\n3. What indications of additional expansion of infrastructure in the near future can be detected?\n4. What does the disposition of Baykar infrastructure indicate about the relationship between this company and the Turkish military? Methods This GEOINT-enhanced economic analysis, like other standard economic analyses, is focused on capability and company efficiencies. It incorporates commercially available satellite imagery alongside numerous other open sources. Baykar and its most prominent executives, Haluk Bayraktar (CEO) and Sel\u00e7uk Bayraktar (CTO), generate a substantial amount of content via social media and through their corporate website. Turkish and international media also contributed useful information. In many cases, social media and other media content were geolocated to a particular site, providing coverage of that site unavailable through satellite imagery alone. For further clarity, the source of each observation cited is noted in the text or in a caption. A lexicon of specific terms listed in Table 1 is used to communicate estimative probability. Table 1: Terms used to convey probability. Original work by author.  Executive Summary Baykar created an industrial campus with at least 54,235m2 of production and administrative space in the Esenyurt district of Istanbul between 2014 and 2022.\nBaykar began operating its first permanent, dedicated flight test and training facility at Ke\u015fan Military Airport in 2014, and a second at Tekirda\u011f-\u00c7orlu Atat\u00fcrk Airport in 2019.\nBaykar expanded the hangar space available for UCAV operations by nearly five times, from 2,270m2 at one airfield to 10,942m2 at two airfields, between 2014 and 2022. It also improved aprons and runways, established specialized communications systems, and built other permanent infrastructure.\nBaykar is likely to complete additional manufacturing space at its current production campus and begin developing a new, adjacent property over the next one to two years.\nBaykar is likely to add hangar, administrative, and support buildings, new apron space, or a combination of these to its test and training sites over the next two years.\nBaykar likely remains committed to constructing additional production, training, and\/or test facilities in Ukraine in the near future.\nThe Baykar test site at Tekirda\u011f-\u00c7orlu Airport is likely to host prototypes of the stealthy Bayraktar K\u0131z\u0131lelma turbofan-powered UCAV starting in 2023. The test site at Ke\u015fan Military Airport is likely to host the Bayraktar TB3 carrier-based UCAV beginning in late 2022.\nThe geographic distribution of Baykar operations reflects a close relationship with the Turkish military. All major Baykar facilities are either within or adjacent to military bases belonging to the 1st Army of the Turkish Land Forces. Baykar uses former military land, buildings, and airfields in its operations. Background The story of Baykar has been highly publicized in recent years, and therefore this report will provide only a brief outline to establish the necessary analytical context. Baykar Makina (Baykar Machines) was founded in 1981 in Istanbul by \u00d6zdemir Bayraktar (1949 \u2013 2021) as an auto parts and machining business. The elder Bayraktar had three sons: Haluk Bayraktar (b. 1978), Sel\u00e7uk Bayraktar (b. 1979), and Ahmet Bayraktar (b. 1983). Sel\u00e7uk received a Master\u2019s degree in unmanned aircraft systems from the University of Pennsylvania in 2004, and at this time, he and his father decided to pursue a mutual interest in aeronautics and refocus Baykar on developing UAVs. Haluk joined them as general manager and Ahmet as financial manager. Sel\u00e7uk divided his time between Baykar and further postgraduate studies at MIT and Georgia Tech before returning to Turkey permanently in 2007 as Baykar\u2019s CTO. Baykar partnered with Kale Kal\u0131p, a larger Turkish defense and aerospace firm, to help develop its designs. It achieved its first commercial success with the Bayraktar Mini UAV, which entered service with the Turkish military in 2007. By 2009, it had developed a \u201cTactical\u201d UAV, the \u201c\u00c7ald\u0131ran,\u201d as well as an unmanned helicopter dubbed \u201cMalazgirt.\u201d The latter received only a small one-time order, but Baykar was awarded a contract in 2010 to develop the \u201c\u00c7ald\u0131ran\u201d prototype into the TB2 (Tactical UAV, Block 2), which entered service in 2014. The Medium-Altitude, Long-Endurance (MALE) TB2 included a number of features that were groundbreaking at the time, including a triple-redundant flight control system and the ability to take off, land, and taxi autonomously. It was also the first Turkish UAV to be armed with air-to-ground munitions, a project which Baykar undertook with its own resources in 2015. In 2017, as the Bayraktar TB2 became the dominant UCAV of the Turkish armed security services, Baykar established programs for more advanced unmanned aircraft: a turboprop-powered High-Altitude, Long-Endurance (HALE) UCAV, the Ak\u0131nc\u0131 (\u201cRaider\u201d), and a stealthy turbofan-powered UCAV, the K\u0131z\u0131lelma (\u201cRed Apple,\u201d a Turkish proverb for a distant goal). The former entered service in 2021, while the latter is expected to fly for the first time in 2023. An advanced naval variant of the TB2, the Bayraktar TB3, is also under development for the air wing of the Turkish LHD Anadolu. The members of the Bayraktar family, in addition to their expertise in manufacturing UAVs, shared a profound sense of nationalism. Their products were designed to be completely indigenous (\u201cnational\u201d), requiring no major foreign components \u2013 a goal that emerged partly from the refusal of the United States to sell Turkey the MQ-1 Predator UCAV in the early 2000s. Perhaps as a consequence of this, they developed connections to Turkey\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) soon after attaining commercial success. In 2016, Sel\u00e7uk Bayraktar became the son-in-law of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan when he married his youngest daughter, S\u00fcmeyye. President Erdo\u011fan subsequently granted Baykar a number of lucrative government benefits, including tax and export duty exemptions, through Presidential decrees in 2019 and 2021. Baykar\u2019s drones have been used to support Turkey\u2019s foreign policy goals and those of its allies, including the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) in 2019, Azerbaijan in 2020, and most recently, Ukraine in 2022. They have also won Turkey a large share of the international market for unmanned combat aircraft due to the TB2\u2019s mixture of affordability, combat effectiveness, and ease of operation. In 2022, Baykar (now Baykar Teknoloji, or Baykar Technologies) was both a multimillion-dollar enterprise and a national icon. Facility Locations Baykar Technologies has a global footprint. However, most of its activities are concentrated at three major sites in East Thrace, the European region of Turkey. All research, development, and manufacturing, as well as limited product testing, takes place in the western Esenyurt district of Istanbul at the \u00d6zdemir Bayraktar R&D and Production Center (\u201cEsenyurt\u201d). This site is Baykar\u2019s production campus and corporate headquarters. Figure 1: Reference map of East Thrace. Original work by author. Source: Baykar Technologies website.

History Figure 3: Annotated images of Ke\u015fan Military Airport development. Copyright Maxar 2013, 2021. Annotations by author.  Between 28 Apr 2016 and 21 Nov 2021, hangar facilities were expanded from three hangars with approximately 2,270m2 of aircraft space to five hangars with approximately 6,050m2 of aircraft space. The latest was constructed between satellite imagery dated 14 Oct 2021 and 21 Nov 2021. One of the original hangars, a Quonset-style structure near the apron, was fully enclosed and given exterior doors.\nBetween satellite imagery dated 25 Sep 2020 and a video dated 04 Dec 2020, the asphalt runway was lengthened from 1,300m to 1,550m.\nBetween satellite imagery dated 02 Sep 2018 and 13 Jun 2019, two metal frame towers hosting UAV communications antennas were constructed. A third was added between 13 Jun 2019 and 14 Mar 2020.\nBetween imagery dated 02 Sep 2018 and 13 Jun 2019, an equipment shelter was erected on the apron. Figure 4: Annotated images of Ke\u015fan Military Airport showing hangar construction. Copernicus Sentinel, 2021. Annotations by author.  Current Disposition Baykar operations encompass the entire area of Ke\u015fan Military Airport, which contains the Ke\u015fan Flight Training and Test Center. The airport is surrounded by open fields and has no security fence, although the main hangar building is fenced. The site is approximately 144km from \u00c7orlu along the E84 highway and 207km from Esenyurt along the E84 and E80 highways. Operational Capacity Ke\u015fan likely has the ability to store approximately 30 TB2 UCAVs in five hangars (see estimates below). One or two TB2 UCAVs have been visible in nine out of 16 satellite imagery captures of the airfield from 17 Feb 2017 to 05 Oct 2021, suggesting steady rotation of aircraft in and out of the hangars, with aircraft emerging shortly before they fly and returning afterwards. Figure 5: Annotated image of Ke\u015fan Flight Training and Test Center. Copyright Maxar 2021. Annotations by author.  Ke\u015fan Flight Training and Test Center Main Hangar. Interior photographs of this two-story 96m x 40m hangar show that it can accommodate at least 20 TB2 UCAVs simultaneously on its ground floor. It also contains offices and classrooms. It is surrounded by a 7,000m2 concrete pad enclosed by a security fence. Figure 6: The main hangar shortly after construction in 2016. Note the presence of a security fence. Source: \u00c7amburnu Haber (local media) Facebook account. Quonset Hangar. This hangar can store at least four TB2 UCAVs simultaneously. It was also used in 2017 for assembly of new aircraft arriving from the factory, although whether it still serves this role is unknown. 30m x 30m Hangar. This structure was built in 2021 next to the Quonset hangar (see Development above). Given its relatively brief construction period, it is likely a tension fabric structure similar to the secondary hangars built at \u00c7orlu. Frame Hangars (2). These single-story structures are original to the site. The southern one, nearer to the apron, is likely used more often. Given their dimensions, they could likely accommodate at least three TB2s each. Figure 8: Still from a video taken of the flight apron at Ke\u015fan in December 2020 by a Bayraktar Mini UAV. It shows one of the communications towers, as well as a relay trailer (upper right), four GCS trailers, a mobile Baykar-operated GCS trailer, a 6x6 truck likely awaiting installation of a GCS, three generator trailers, and two Bayraktar TB2s.

Annotations by author.  Military Presence Both Ke\u015fan Military Airport and the Gen. Kaz\u0131m Karabekir Barracks to the north are associated with the 4th Mechanized Infantry Brigade. This unit is part of the 2nd Corps of the 1st Army of the Turkish Land Forces. At least two mechanized infantry battalions and two tank battalions, as well as support units, are stationed at Kaz\u0131m Karabekir. Analysis of satellite imagery indicates the presence of armored vehicles near the airfield both before and after Baykar began using it, generally to the east and northeast sides of the main runway. Another sizable military base, Gen. Fevzi Meng\u00fc\u00e7 Barracks, is located approximately 1.8km to the east of the airport but has no direct connection by road. It likely hosts the 4th Mechanized Artillery Battalion, which is also a formation of the 2nd Corps. The two military bases are approximately one kilometer southeast of the town of \u0130zzetiye, the nearest settlement. Future Activity More enlargement of existing site infrastructure is highly likely over the next two years, considering estimated increases in TB2 production. This may include additional support buildings and enlargement of the apron. Any construction on the eastern side of the airfield is likely to come at the expense of the remaining military structures there.\nThis site is likely to host the Bayraktar TB3 UCAV, an advanced and heavier derivative of the Bayraktar TB2, for flight testing and possibly training operations. Baykar plans for this UCAV to make its first flight in late 2022. Ke\u015fan is logically preferable as a TB3 host to the other Baykar test site, \u00c7orlu, because of its existing association with the similar TB2 program. Baykar-owned TB2 testbed \u201cT-PT1\u201d and several serial production TB2s underwent intensive testing at the site during 2022; this included touch-and-go landings common in carrier operations. The additional 250m of runway length added between 25 Sep 2020 and 04 Dec 2020 was likely planned in expectation of the TB3 as well. This UCAV has a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 1450kg, over twice the 700kg MTOW of the TB2, and logically will require additional space to become airborne. \u00c7orlu Location: Tekirda\u011f Province, Turkey (41.142468, 27.920168) Figure 10: Annotated image of Tekirda\u011f-\u00c7orlu Atat\u00fcrk Airport and surrounding area. Copyright Maxar 2021. Annotations by author.  History Figure 11: Annotated images of \u00c7orlu Flight Training and Test Center development. Copyright Maxar 2019, 2021. Annotations by author.  Development The \u00c7orlu Flight Training and Test Center, a secure complex including an apron, hangars, and support buildings, was constructed on the site of a 400m x 130m parking area near the military apron starting in early 2019. By the first flight of the Ak\u0131nc\u0131 on 06 Dec 2019, the Center had an area of approximately 18,000m2. It was expanded again to 30,000m2 between imagery dated 05 Mar 2021 and 20 Nov 2021.\nBetween 08 Mar 2019 and 16 Nov 2021, the hangar facilities available to Baykar were expanded from one hangar with approximately 840m2 of aircraft space to four hangars with approximately 4,892m2 of aircraft space. All three new hangars were constructed within the \u00c7orlu Flight Training and Test Center.\nApproximately 14,400m2 of concrete apron was constructed within the \u00c7orlu Flight Training and Test Center between imagery dated 16 Apr 2019 and 20 Nov 2021.\nTwo metal towers with platforms for control antennas, similar to those observed in Ke\u015fan, were constructed between imagery dated 08 Mar 2019 and 10 Aug 2020.\nA probable administration building was constructed in the northwest corner of the Center between imagery dated 25 Mar 2021 and 09 Feb 2022. Current Disposition Baykar operations at \u00c7orlu are divided spatially between the \u00c7orlu Flight Training and Test Center, accessed through a gate-controlled road from the Gen. Faruk G\u00fcrler Barracks, and the commercial terminal of the airport, accessed through the main civilian airport gate. Some operations also take place on the northern military apron. Only two airlines used \u00c7orlu for passenger flights in July 2022, Cairo Air and Pegasus Air, and they both ran irregular schedules. The site is approximately 78km from the production campus at Esenyurt along the E80, E84, and D100 highways, and approximately 144km from Ke\u015fan along the E84 highway. Operational Capacity The three hangars within \u00c7orlu Flight Training and Test Center can likely accommodate five to seven Ak\u0131nc\u0131 UCAVs at once. If additional space is required, Baykar has been known to use the northern military apron as a parking area. Seven Ak\u0131nc\u0131 were seen there in July 2022 for an \u201celephant walk\u201d photoshoot. A pre-existing hangar on this apron can likely also host aircraft. No TB2 UCAVs have yet been identified in satellite imagery of \u00c7orlu. Table 3: Akinci, Akinci GCS, and TB2 GCS Sightings at \u00c7orlu, 2019-2021. Original work by author.

Annotations by author.  \u00c7orlu Flight Training and Test Center Main Hangar. This 52m x 40m structure can hold at least three Ak\u0131nc\u0131 UCAVs. It has also been observed to house one Ak\u0131nc\u0131, one TB2, and two Pipestrel Sinus motor gliders simultaneously. The side rooms contain offices, training classrooms, and a flight control center with an 8-panel display and multiple computer workstations.\nSecondary Hangars (2). These 45m x 30m tension fabric structures are used to shelter Ak\u0131nc\u0131 UCAVs and ground equipment. They have not been observed holding more than a single Ak\u0131nc\u0131 each.\nProbable Administration Building. This building likely houses offices.\nCommunications Platforms (2). These are shorter scaffolds holding probable UAV communications antennas, similar to the larger communications towers nearby. Figure 13: Annotated image of Tekirda\u011f-\u00c7orlu Atat\u00fcrk Airport military apron. Copyright Airbus 2022. Annotations by author.  Military Apron Hangar. This frame hangar, original to the military apron, can likely accommodate at least three TB2-sized vehicles. Baykar likely makes use of the space, as evidenced by the presence of vans near it in videos of flight operations. It is probable that aircraft are occasionally stored here.\nCommunications Towers (2). Like their counterparts at Ke\u015fan, these towers are designed to support communications with UCAVs.\nStorage Building. This structure is also original. It is likely used to hold equipment used in operations, and may also contain equipment and aircraft awaiting delivery to customers.\nSecurity Checkpoints (2). These checkpoints control access to the apron from the barracks to the north and west. A seemingly uncontrolled entrance also exists further from the hangar and storage building.

Military Presence \u00c7orlu borders the Gen. Faruk G\u00fcrler Barracks, home to the 105th Artillery Regiment, to the north. This regiment is part of the 5th Corps of the 1st Army of the Turkish Land Forces. The \u00c7orlu Flight Training and Test Center connect directly to the barracks via an access road. Baykar\u2019s facilities were built adjacent to the military apron and include connecting driveways to the base access road. Satellite imagery analysis indicates that approximately 39,800m2 of base land was appropriated by Baykar to build \u00c7orlu Flight Training and Test Center and an adjacent parking lot between 2019 and 2022. Future Activity Additional enlargement of the existing infrastructure at \u00c7orlu is likely over the next two years, considering estimated increases in both Ak\u0131nc\u0131 and TB2 production (see Production section in Part II). This may include additional support buildings and new apron space within the \u00c7orlu Flight Training and Test Center. It is also possible that new facilities will be constructed along the military apron. Any construction at either location is likely to take place on land associated with the Gen. Faruk G\u00fcrler Barracks.\nThis site is likely to host the Bayraktar K\u0131z\u0131lelma UCAV when it begins flight tests in 2023. Ke\u015fan, the only other Baykar-operated test facility, is unlikely to have adequate runway length for this aircraft. The known MTOW of the K\u0131z\u0131lelma is 6 tons (5,443kg), significantly higher than the TB2 (700kg) but less than the Akinci (6,000kg), which already operates from \u00c7orlu. Additionally, the K\u0131z\u0131lelma will be powered by a turbofan engine, necessitating on-site jet fuel storage. \u00c7orlu possesses a POL farm with jet fuel storage tanks while Ke\u015fan does not. Esenyurt Figure 16: Annotated image of Baykar production campus and surrounding area. Copyright Maxar 2022. Annotations by author.  History The land now occupied by the Baykar production campus was an empty field prior to September 2016, with the exception of two areas within the perimeter of the nearby Had\u0131mk\u00f6y Barracks military base. Baykar likely purchased the property in 2015 or 2016. Land owned by Baykar was designated \u201cBaykar Makina Inc. Istanbul Private Industry Zone\u201d (Baykar Makina Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi \u0130stanbul \u00d6zel End\u00fcstri B\u00f6lgesine) by decree of President Erdo\u011fan on 03 Oct 2019, a status that entitled the company to special benefits including reimbursement of infrastructure costs, expedited licensing, and waiver of normal business fees. Figure 17: Annotated images of Baykar production campus development. Copyright Maxar 2016, 2018, 2021, 2022. Annotations by author.  The land area within the Private Industry Zone expanded by over 100%, from 18.2ha to 40.4ha, between 03 Oct 2019 and 10 Mar 2021 with the acquisition of a new undeveloped property to the northeast of the existing campus. Figure 18: Land incorporated into the Baykar Makina Inc. Istanbul Private Industry Zone. Both parcels together are listed as totaling ~40.4 hectares. Captions were translated from Turkish by author. Source: Official Gazette of the Republic of Turkey. Two large factory buildings with a combined 54,257m2 of production and administrative space were constructed between 15 Sep 2016 and 12 Jul 2019. An engine test building and an aircraft test hangar were added between 24 December 2017 and 12 Jun 2018, followed by a concrete test track and control tower between 12 Jun 2018 and 12 Jul 2019. An R&D facility, the \u00d6zdemir Bayraktar National Technology Center, was built between imagery dated 12 Jun 2018 and 17 Jul 2022. Outdoor and probable indoor parking areas with approximately 19,300m2 of parking space were built between imagery dated 23 Nov 2019 and 17 Jul 2022. A variety of employee amenities, including parks and a cafeteria, were constructed between 03 Nov 2019 and 25 Jun 2022. Preparatory development activity, including surveying and delivery of construction materials, took place at the second property between imagery dated 03 Aug 2021 and 20 May 2022.

Undeveloped Property Probable Temporary Storage Shelters (6). These structures are likely used to store construction materials and equipment.\nParking Area: This area has been cleared for use by construction vehicles. Twelve vehicles and numerous storage containers were visible here in imagery dated 20 May 2022. Figure 21: Annotated image of Baykar production campus and nearby military bases. Copyright Maxar 2022. Annotations by author. While previous Baykar workshops were not located near military bases, this changed with the opening of the current production campus, which directly borders the Had\u0131mk\u00f6y Barracks to the north. These barracks house elements of the 52nd Tactical Armored Division, part of the 2nd Corps of the 1st Army of the Turkish Land Forces. A public Facebook page indicates the presence of the 1st Army Air Defense Battalion. At least three batteries of GDF Skyguard 35mm antiaircraft guns with their fire control radars are based here, and satellite imagery analysis indicates that they are regularly deployed in an area immediately beyond the northwestern perimeter of the Baykar campus. As the deployment of these guns was visible in satellite imagery dated 14 Sep 2012, long before Baykar's arrival, it is unlikely that the Turkish military intended for them to provide the factory with air defense. Figure 23: An image of the Ejder Yal\u00e7\u0131n from the manufacturer\u2019s website, top, and a video still captured at the Esenyurt site in 2019. Source: Nurol Makina website and Baykar YouTube channel. It is unknown whether the entire land parcel obtained by Baykar in Esenyurt originally belonged to the military. However, at least some of it did. Analysis of satellite imagery reveals that two areas within the perimeter of the Had\u0131mk\u00f6y Barracks totaling approximately 55,700m2 were cleared between 2019 and 2020. The 12 large buildings on them, including several barracks and\/or administrative structures, were demolished. Future Activity Three new buildings were visibly under construction at the original Baykar-owned property in Esenyurt in imagery dated 17 Jul 2022. All are likely to be completed in the next one to two years.\n\nA building with a foundation footprint measuring approximately 14,600m2. This is the most recent building to begin construction, between imagery dated 14 Jan 2022 and 20 May 2022, and the only one to remain unidentified. It is likely a third factory building. Haluk Bayraktar cited plans to create additional production space in Esenyurt on 29 Jan 2021, following the construction of the main and second factory buildings.\nThe \u00d6zdemir Bayraktar National Technology Center.\nA probable multistory parking garage.\nConstruction had not yet begun at the more recently acquired property. However, the appearance of construction hardstands, storage containers, and vehicles suggests that it is imminent.\nIt is likely that, with the completion of additional parking space, the test track will undergo more use in its intended purpose. Initially unobstructed, observations on 03 Aug 2021, 14 Jan 2022, and 25 Jun 2022 indicated that it was being used as a carpark, likely to add employee parking capacity before more permanent facilities were built. Other areas to the east of the main factory and around the periphery of the second factory may also be cleared, enabling them to be devoted solely to open storage of material components, waste materials, and finished products.\nIt is likely that the entrance to the \u00d6zdemir Bayraktar National Technology Center, which borders the Had\u0131mk\u00f6y-Ho\u015fdere road from the east side of the land parcel, will become the new main entrance to the campus. Architectural renditions indicate that this entrance will branch into two access roads, one for staff and the other for visitors. Heavy delivery vehicles will likely continue to use the current southern entrance, as this provides better access to the factory buildings within the campus.\nOn 17 Jul 2022, all of the land on the original Esenyurt land parcel had either already been developed or was the site of active construction. Any new buildings will likely need to be built on the second property. Whether this area will host additional factory buildings, administrative buildings, or other structures is unclear. Conclusion Baykar has worked aggressively to expand its infrastructure over time, a process that began in 2004 but accelerated during the mid-2010s. It obtained its current production, training, and test facilities between 2014 and 2019. Between 2014 and 2022, the amount of production and administrative space likely expanded by over 50 times, while the amount of land owned by the company expanded from 0 to 40.4ha. Hangar space, a benchmark of aircraft handling capacity, expanded by nearly five times. Much of this growth was facilitated by the company\u2019s proximity to Turkish military bases, which provided it with both land and buildings.

This content is different than other Tearline content because the primary author is a government employee. Tearline is experimenting with this content type to broaden dissemination. Activity Compatibility testing was conducted of various Global Navigation Systems in 2019. Article Collection and practical use of most modern geospatial data require that the data be represented in a well-understood global coordinate system. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has the mission to provide that global coordinate system and make it available for use in countless defense, intelligence, and civil applications. The scientific discipline where this happens is known as geodesy (aka geodetic science). The Global Positioning System (GPS), for example, operates in the NGA-developed World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). This collection of models includes not only a global coordinate system but also a mathematical model of the Earth\u2019s gravitational and magnetic fields, as well as other models that describe the small irregularities of the Earth\u2019s motions as it rotates, wobbles, and travels in orbit around the sun. All real-time users of GPS, whether they know it or not, are using the NGA-established global coordinate system, known in modern terminology as the WGS 84 Terrestrial Reference Frame. An important topic of interest to NGA is the level of agreement among the terrestrial reference frames used by GPS, the Russian GLONASS, the Chinese BeiDou, and the European Union\u2019s Galileo. Each of these global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are operated independently of each other, yet commercial GNSS receivers all expect to use the broadcast radio signals from all of them in a combined so-called multi-GNSS receiver. This is why compatibility, or interoperability, among these systems, is an important issue. Together, for the foreseeable future, these GNSSs \u2014 through their respective terrestrial reference frames \u2014 now provide the foundational geospatial framework for planet Earth. This is an important issue to sort out because location services affect services on your phone such as driving directions, restaurant location services, weather updates, geotagging your vacation pictures from your phone to social media, and many more. The journal paper at the following link provides a rigorous assessment of the compatibility issue using data collected over an eight-week period in 2019.

{"article":"The Ice Curtain_ Kola Peninsula Part 2_ Expanded Maritime Facilities.json","text":"Arctic  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors The Ice Curtain: Kola Peninsula Part 2: Expanded Maritime Facilities  In partnership with \n CSIS \n and written by \n Matthew Melino, \n Heather Conley, \n and Joseph Bermudez  Latest storage facility construction on-time Impact enchanced maritime capability Published Mar 10 2020 2\u00a0years, 10\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  GEOINT analysis confirms Russian public declarations to expand the storage facilities at Okolnaya submarine support base and Gadzhiyevo submarine base.  Expanded maritime assets add to Russia's \"defense in depth\" of the Kola peninsula while stealthier submarines enhance the regime's survivability and challenge NATO's sea lanes of communication in the North Atlantic. Activity GEOINT shows steady construction activity expanding storage facilities and bunkers at both submarine bases. Sometimes Russian Arctic public declarations do not match the GEOINT analysis such as slow progress at Tiksi and Severomorsk.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  New Missile Storage Facility at Okolnaya Submarine Support Base The kolnaya submarine support base (69.095773 N, 33.450602 E) is located on the eastern shores of Guba Okolnaya (Okolnaya Bay), Murmanskaya Oblast, and serves as one of several strategically important Russian Navy submarine bases and submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) storage and loading facilities on the Kola Peninsula. Other SLBM loading facilities include the adzhiyevo Submarine Base and Severodvinsk Submarine Base.1 In addition to housing and maintaining SLBMs, Okolnaya likely stores the nuclear warheads. While most often described as a submarine support base, it likely also supports the cruise missile requirements of other Northern Fleet surface combatants such as the warships based across the bay at the Severomorsk Navy Base. The Okolnaya submarine support base has been associated with nuclear armed SLBMs since the late-1950s. As an historical footnote, the base appears to have played a minor but important role during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis when nuclear weapons may have been transported from Okolnaya to Cuba and back again during October-November 1962 by the merchant vessel Aleksandrovsk. The voyage of the Aleksandrovsk was unique in several ways: it was the only merchant vessel known to have carried missile-associated equipment from Cuba to the Soviet Arctic and it was one of the first to depart after the Soviet decision had been made to remove strategic weapons from Cuba. The vessel may have carried nuclear warheads to and from Cuba, perhaps without ever having offloaded them. By transferring nuclear warheads via this Arctic facility, the Soviets probably hoped to avoid any possible radiological monitoring or surveillance in either the Danish or Turkish Straits,2 underscoring the importance of the Arctic as an avenue of approach to the United States. (New Missile Storage Facility at Okolnaya Submarine Support Base) During 2013, media reports indicated that the Okolnaya submarine support base would be expanded by the construction of a large storage facility for more than 100 RSM-56 Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missile (NATO reporting name: SS-NX-30 or SS-N-32). The Bulava equips the Project 955\/955A Dolgorukiy (Borey) Class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBN), each of which can carry 16 missiles. The Dolgorukiy Class SSBNs are expected to eventually replace the Delta III and Delta IV-class SSBNs currently in service with the Northern Fleet.3 (New Missile Storage Facility at Okolnaya Submarine Support Base) (New Missile Storage Facility at Okolnaya Submarine Support Base) The location chosen for the new storage facility (69.114642 N, 33.525728 E) is 3.7-kilometers northeast of the main Okolnaya facilities on the site of an old open storage facility that consisted of 14 large revetments, several support buildings, and a large parking area. Satellite imagery shows that by May 2014 construction started and by August 2015 there were a total of 31 weapons storage bunkers under construction (none of which were completed) while excavations began on others.4 (New Missile Storage Facility at Okolnaya Submarine Support Base) (New Missile Storage Facility at Okolnaya Submarine Support Base) By July 30, 2017 the number of bunkers completed or under construction rose to 38 and construction of what appears to be a triple fence security perimeter began.5 (New Missile Storage Facility at Okolnaya Submarine Support Base) (New Missile Storage Facility at Okolnaya Submarine Support Base) Most recently, in satellite imagery from September 4, 2019, there are a total of 41 weapons storage bunkers (35 completed and 6 under construction) and excavations for at least an additional 9 storage bunkers. Additionally, there are several new small support buildings and construction work on the triple fence security perimeter slowly continues. Media reports indicate that construction of the facility is scheduled to be completed during 2020 and given the current rate of progress, and barring unforeseen circumstances, this projected date appears feasible.6 (New Missile Storage Facility at Okolnaya Submarine Support Base) (New Missile Storage Facility at Okolnaya Submarine Support Base) (New Missile Storage Facility at Okolnaya Submarine Support Base) (New Missile Storage Facility at Okolnaya Submarine Support Base) All of the storage bunkers observed to date consist of an approximately 40-meter-by-32-meter concrete structure that is protected on three sides by earthen berms up against the sides, with an approximately 52-meter-by-20-meter concrete pad on the fourth open side and a final 75-meter-by-18-meter protective berm in front of it. Thus, each storage bunker occupies a footprint of approximately 75-meters-by-90-meters. Internally each bunker consists of four approximately 20-meter-by-32-meter storage bays. Adjacent to all the weapons storage bunkers is a smaller auxiliary bunker of varying sizes for unidentified purpose (potentially for power and environmental controls). It is assumed that when completed the facility will consist of a total of 50 storage bunkers, each with four storage bays, with the potential to house a total of 200 RSM-56 Bulava SLBMs, corroborating media reports from 2017.7 While almost all media reports describe the new storage facility as being for nuclear-armed RSM-56 Bulava SLBMs, there is nothing to prevent sensitive non-nuclear munitions (e.g., cruise missiles, etc.) from also being stored. It is also likely that aside from ballistic and cruise missile support, the base provides other submarine-related support services. A second missile loading facility was built during 2012-2018 with the original missile loading facility on the northern shore of the facility.8 This is likely in support of the larger role of the RSM-56 Bulava SLBMs stored at Okolnaya, and the slowly increasing number of Dolgorukiy Class SSBNs in the Northern Fleet. New Missile Storage Facility at Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base The Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base (69.258878 N, 33.335251 E) is located on the eastern shores of Guba Sayda (Sayda Bay), Murmanskaya Oblast, and serves as one of several strategically important Russian Navy submarine bases and submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) storage and loading facilities on the Kola Peninsula.9 It reportedly is the primary home port for the Northern Fleets Project 667BDRM Delfin (Delta IV) and Project 955\/955A Dolgorukiy (Borey) Class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBN).10 As such, the base not only houses and maintains the R-29MU2 Liner (NATO reporting name: SS-N-23) submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) for the Delta IV and RSM-56 Bulava (NATO reporting name: SS-NX-30 or SS-N-32) SLBMs for the Project 955\/955A Dolgorukiy SSBNs but also the nuclear warheads they support. The base may also support the cruise missile requirements of Northern Fleet surface combatants. (New Missile Storage Facility at Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base) During 2013, media reports indicated that the Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base would expand to include the construction of a new SLBM storage facility.11 The location chosen for the new storage facility (69.251165 N, 33.357418 E) is one kilometer south of the main Gadzhiyevo facilities on the site of an existing storage facility. The existing facility consists of several vehicle maintenance and storage facilities and yards, bunkered storage facilities, open storage yards, and a number of support buildings. All but the bunkered storage facilities and open storage yards would be retained for the new facility. Satellite imagery shows that by May 29, 2014 construction had started and there was a total of 3 weapons storage bunkers under construction and excavations had begun on others. (New Missile Storage Facility at Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base) (New Missile Storage Facility at Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base) By May 23, 2016 the number of bunkers under construction (none of which were completed at the time) rose to 10 and excavation work for a new support building began. (New Missile Storage Facility at Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base) (New Missile Storage Facility at Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base) Most recently, satellite imagery from June 30, 2019, shows that there are a total of 10 weapons storage bunkers with 5 completed and 5 under construction. (New Missile Storage Facility at Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base) (New Missile Storage Facility at Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base) (New Missile Storage Facility at Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base) (New Missile Storage Facility at Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base) (New Missile Storage Facility at Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base) Space within the existing storage facility remains for additional storage bunkers should the Russians decide to build them. Media reports suggest that construction of the facility is scheduled to be completed during 2020 to coincide with the launch of the eighth Dolgorukiy Class SSBN.12 Given the current rate of progress, and barring unforeseen circumstances, this projected date appears feasible. All of the storage bunkers observed to date are similar to those built at the Okolnaya submarine support base and consist of an approximately 40-meter-by-32-meter concrete structure that is protected on three sides by protective berms up against the sides, with an approximately 55-meter-by-20-meter concrete pad on the fourth open side and a final 65-meter-by-20-meter earthen berm in front of it. Thus, each storage bunker site occupies a footprint of approximately 90-meters-by-80-meters. Internally each bunker consists of four approximately 20-meter-by-32-meter storage bays. Adjacent to all the weapons storage bunkers is a smaller auxiliary bunker of varying sizes for unidentified purpose (potentially for power and environmental controls). At present, there are a total of 10 storage bunkers, each with four storage bays, which would imply that the facility has the potential to house a total of 40 RSM-56 Bulava or R-29MU2 Liner SLBMs, although most reports state that they will be used for the nuclear-armed RSM-56 Bulava. Regardless, there is nothing to prevent sensitive or non-nuclear munitions (e.g., cruise missiles, etc.) from also being stored here. Unlike the Okolnaya submarine support base, no second missile loading facility has yet to be built at the Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base. Analysis Russia's 2017-updated Naval strategy elevated the role of its maritime forces in securing Russia's Arctic domain. The strategy builds on President Putin's promise in 2010 to spend more than 20 trillion rubles to modernize 70% of all Russian military equipment by 2020. Under this modernization plan, Russia's naval forces are a priority, harkening back to the Cold War when Soviet maritime capabilities posed a formidable challenge to NATO. Upgrades at Gadzhiyevo and Okolnaya reinforce defensive and offensive capabilities around the Kola Peninsula. Naval bases housing Delta IV- and Borei-class SSBN are a key component of Russia's bastion defense concept. These SSBN, when equipped with SLBMs, are the backbone of Russia's sea-based component of its nuclear-triad. Importantly, the SSBNs represent Russia's second-strike capabilities and serve as a deterrent against potential adversaries. The Borei-class in particular boasts improved stealth capabilities as well as increased SLBM payload, adding to Russia's defense in depth of the Kola Peninsula. Stealthier submarines such as these enhance the regimes survivability and poses a challenge to NATO's sea lanes of communication in the North Atlantic as the Alliance is increasing its anti-submarine warfare capabilities. While the primary objective of the SSBNs is defensive, they also serve as a tool of power projection beyond the Kola Peninsula. Adm. James Foggo, commander of Allied Joint Force Command Naples, warned about Russia's renewed capabilities in the North Atlantic and the Arctic. Of particular concern is the ability of Russian submarines to project power through the GIUK Gap. NATO recently tracked 10 Russian submarines south of Iceland testing their stealth abilities and demonstrating their capacity to threaten the strategic maritime route between the United States and Northern Europe. The exercise also exposed Russia's ability to breakout into the North Atlantic and threaten the east coast of the United States. Russia's defense of its western Arctic territory is determined by its ability to control the surrounding maritime space and assert its presence in maritime choke points like the Greenland-Iceland-UK-Norway (GIUK-N) Gap. To this end, Gadzhiyevo and Okolnaya are critical staging grounds and house Russia's most advanced capabilities. References and Notes 1.

{"article":"Part 2_ Have Any of Xinjiangs Detention Facilities Closed_.json","text":"Human Rights  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Part 2: Have Any of Xinjiang\u2019s Detention Facilities Closed?  In partnership with \n RAND \n and written by \n Eric Robinson \n and Sean Mann  Latest >87% detention facilities still active Impact detention activity higher than China's claims Published Feb 26 2021 1\u00a0year, 10\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  This report, the second in a three-part series, employs a novel empirical approach to systematically assess the current operating status of known detention facilities in Xinjiang using nighttime lighting. This analysis provides new, empirical evidence to suggest that the overwhelming majority of detention facilities in Xinjiang remain active, operational, and in many cases, still under construction \u2013 despite Chinese claims to the contrary. About This Series: A growing body of research has systematically documented China\u2019s efforts to imprison, detain, and re-educate ethnic Uyghur and minority groups throughout its western Xinjiang province. In this three-part investigation, RAND researchers explore new data on nighttime lighting in Xinjiang to offer new, empirical insights into China\u2019s efforts to reeducate, detain, and imprison its Uyghur and ethnic minority populations across Xinjiang.  Activity GEOINT analysis of nighttime lighting and satellite imagery data is conducted to assess the likely operating status of 380 known detention facilities in Xinjiang. This analysis reveals little evidence to suggest that the systematic detention and reeducation of Uyghur and ethnic minority populations in Xinjiang has declined over time, despite official Chinese government claims to the contrary. Article  Timeline  Graphs  In the first report in this series, RAND introduced its approach to systematically and empirically diagnose the level of activity at Uyghur and ethnic minority detention facilities in Xinjiang using nighttime lighting data. Through analysis of these data, our first report offered new evidence of the explosive growth in detention facilities across Xinjiang as part of a consolidated, thirty-six-month campaign beginning in 2016 through early 2019. As mounting evidence of China's efforts to detain, re-educate, and imprison\u00a0Xinjiang's ethnic Uyghur and minority group population has grown in recent years, Chinese officials have variously denied the existence of these facilities, suggested that they serve only as benign vocational training centers, or that they are necessary to cure ideological diseases in those with problematic ideas sympathetic to radical causes. But since mid-2019, the Chinese government has frequently suggested that its widespread reeducation and forced labor practices in Xinjiang, while still benign in nature, have largely come to an end. Therefore, in this second report, we use monthly data on nighttime lighting in Xinjiang to systematically assess the current operating status of 380 known detention facilities, originally geolocated by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). This analysis provides new, empirical evidence to suggest that the vast majority of detention facilities in Xinjiang remain active, operational, and in many cases, still under new construction \u2013 despite Chinese claims to the contrary. In so doing, this report affirms and amplifies other existing research to suggest that China's detention system in Xinjiang remains highly operational to this day. Background This research analyzes monthly nighttime lighting data over known detention facilities in Xinjiang, based off a dataset of 380 known or suspected facilities originally identified by ASPI. Using the locations of these facilities, we measure the average nighttime lighting over each facility on a monthly basis from 2014 through mid-2020, and identify major periods of uninterrupted growth or decline in nighttime lighting over time. Further details on this portion of our analysis are included in the first report in this series. Figure One below plots the number of detention facilities in our dataset experiencing a major period of growth or decline in nighttime lighting, per month since January 2014. In a given month on this figure, each bar represents the number of distinct detention facilities experiencing an uninterrupted period of growth (blue) or decline (red) in smoothed nighttime lighting. Figure One. Detention Facilities Experiencing Major Growth or Decline in Nighttime Lighting, 2014-2020 Note: Each bar represents the number of facilities, in a given month, experiencing an uninterrupted period of growth (blue) or decline (red) in smoothed nighttime lighting for at least six months. Negative values represent the number of facilities with declining nighttime lighting. Estimates are reported from January 2014 to May 2020. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  In our last report, we focused on understanding the massive expansion of detention facilities across Xinjiang, as shown in blue on this figure. In this report, we turn to focus on evidence of detention facilities experiencing major declines in nighttime lighting over time, as shown in red. Despite the massive growth in detention facilities across Xinjiang between 2016 and early 2019, our analysis suggests that roughly 100 facilities per month (on average) experienced sustained declines in nighttime lighting in more recent months, from early 2019 through mid-2020. At face value, this correlates with official Chinese government claims to have ceased or relaxed its detention measures around this same period of time. But does a decline in nighttime lighting actually imply that these facilities have been closed and decommissioned? Or, does it simply suggest a reversion to ordinary levels of nighttime lighting for active facilities no longer under construction? Methodology To answer this question, we first examined the nighttime lighting trajectories of each individual detention facility in our dataset, looking for common trends that could help identify just those detention facilities with nighttime lighting signatures consistent with possible closure or decommissioning. With few exceptions, a set of four discrete growth trajectories emerged from this analysis that were consistently repeated across all 380 detention facilities in our dataset. These growth trajectories are as follows: 1. Sustained Growth in nighttime lighting over the entire time period analyzed, with no or only marginal major periods of decline; 2. Stable nighttime lighting over time, with either cyclical periods of growth and decline, or no major changes; 3. Growth then Partial Decline in nighttime lighting, suggesting a major period of construction followed by a decline to still elevated levels of nighttime lighting; and 4. Growth then Significant Decline in nighttime lighting, suggesting a major period of construction followed by a decline to levels of nighttime lighting at or near pre-construction levels. Instead of manually assigning each detention facility based upon a visual review of their nighttime lighting over time, we instead developed an objective coding scheme to systematically classify the growth trajectory of each facility into one of these categories. This scheme took into account both the sequence in which a detention facility experienced either growth or decline, and the overall magnitude of these changes. Assessing the Operating Status of Known Detention Facilities Table One below summarizes the results of this classification process, showing the number of facilities in our dataset associated with each growth trajectory, along with the nighttime lighting trajectory of an example facility in each category. Table One. Nighttime Lighting Growth Trajectories of Xinjiang Detention Facilities, 2014-2020 Note: Nighttime lighting estimates are shown from an example camp drawn from each category, plotting both normalized (in blue) and ten month double moving average (in red) nighttime lighting for each month from January 2014 through May 2020. Source: Authors' estimates based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  Overall, nearly half of the detention facilities in our dataset (170) experienced uninterrupted growth in nighttime lighting over time, suggesting that these facilities not only remain active to this day, but have continued to expand and grow since their initial construction. Similarly, 53 additional facilities (14 percent) demonstrate stable nighttime lighting signatures, with either inconsequential periods of growth or decline, or cyclical patterns that imply no major changes in operating status over time. In these cases, we rely upon ASPI's original assessment that these facilities actively serve as detention facilities, finding no evidence from nighttime lighting to suggest otherwise. For an additional 106 facilities (28 percent), we see major periods of growth in nighttime lighting, followed by a partial decline to levels still well above the nighttime lighting seen prior to its initial growth. This implies, albeit not conclusively, that these facilities experienced either a decline in occupancy or an end to construction efforts, but not complete closure. As such, we assess that these facilities also remain active in some form, at least as of the last month in which we measure nighttime lighting in May 2020. Combined, this analysis suggests that at least 87 percent of known Uyghur and ethnic minority detention facilities in Xinjiang exhibit nighttime lighting signatures consistent with ongoing detention efforts. The final growth trajectory focuses on detention facilities experiencing significant declines in nighttime lighting over time, at or near the levels of electricity consumption seen prior to initial growth. Overall, our analysis suggests that only 51 facilities, or 13 percent of all known facilities, fit this pattern. The remainder of this report focuses on these facilities, to the extent that their nighttime lighting signatures may suggest potential closure. Figure Two below maps the location of these facilities across Xinjiang, broken down by their function within the broader Xinjiang detention system. With some exceptions, the majority of these facilities are concentrated in both northwest Xinjiang, along the border with Kazakhstan, and in southern Xinjiang's Hotan and Kashgar prefectures.

Administrative boundaries from GADM.  Investigating Potential Closure of Detention Facilities with Satellite Imagery Significant declines in nighttime lighting could signal a number of different things about the current status of a detention facility. For one, it could signal that a detention facility was constructed but never occupied due to excess capacity elsewhere in the system. Alternatively, it could suggest that a facility proved too costly or remote to operate. In a dense urban area, major declines in nighttime lighting could signal that a facility was demolished to allow for future redevelopment. But large reductions in nighttime lighting alone do not necessarily mean that a facility has closed. It is feasible that large declines in nighttime lighting simply reflect the absence of prior electricity-intensive construction projects, or natural reversion to mean levels of nighttime lighting in otherwise well-electrified areas. Acknowledging these varied interpretations, we then use overhead satellite imagery to provide additional fidelity on the current operating status of these facilities. Using nearly 400 overhead satellite images across these 51 locations, RAND searched for visible indicators of each facility's operating status in relation to its nighttime lighting signature. These indicators fell roughly into three general categories: evidence of human activity, changes in the repair or disrepair of facilities, and outright deconstruction of specific facilities. In terms of visible human activity, overhead images of detention facilities occasionally revealed visible crowds of individuals standing in common areas, primarily at lower-security sites which often included recreational areas within a compound. As such, one marker of likely closure of a facility was the absence of visible human activity seen in prior imagery of the same site. Imagery also revealed distinct changes in the presence of vehicles in parking lots near the gates of some facilities, which offers a useful metric to gauge the presence of workers at such facilities over time. As for evidence of repair and disrepair at specific facilities, we focused solely on those signs likely to indicate an outright change in the operating status of a given facility. This included visible signs of snow removal (or lack thereof) during the winter, and in some cases, clear signs of overgrown vegetation in previously well-kept gardens. Finally, satellite imagery occasionally revealed the complete or partial demolition of detention facilities, suggesting likely closure. On average, we analyzed nearly 8 separate satellite images for each facility over time. This included historical imagery from as early as 2006 (available through Google Earth), as well as a higher concentration of more recent imagery largely from the last two years (available via Digital Globe). In relatively few cases, we lacked sufficient imagery to make a full assessment. But in most cases, we were able to view satellite imagery at key inflection points in the nighttime lighting signature of a given facility, and correlate visible indicators in imagery with the timing of declines in nighttime lighting. In total, we found affirmative evidence in satellite imagery consistent with the likely closure of only 11 detention facilities, out of the broader set of 51 facilities that experienced major declines in nighttime lighting. The locations and general characteristics of these facilities are summarized below in Table Two, along with our rationale for assessment. Table Two. Xinjiang Detention Facilities with Evidence of Likely Closure Source: Authors' estimates based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  Overall, the majority of these 11 facilities appear to be Tier 1 and Tier 2 reeducation centers, although two administrative detention centers (Tier 4) in Kashgar also show evidence consistent with closure. Nearly all of these facilities are located in just three prefectures \u2013Ili (5) in northwest Xinjiang, as well as Hotan (3) and Kashgar (3) in southern Xinjiang. However, these three prefectures account for nearly half of all known detention facilities in Xinjiang, so this is somewhat unsurprising. The most common indicator seen in imagery consistent with likely closure was the absence of former human activity, primarily in terms of major changes in the volume of cars parked outside of detention facilities over time. RAND took careful effort to rule out alternative explanations for such changes in each instance, looking at the day of week and time of day captured for each image, as well as whether such cars could be associated with human activity at adjacent infrastructure. A smaller subset of facilities showed clear signs of demolition. And in some cases, either the absence of human activity or demolition was accompanied by similar changes in nearby adjacent facilities. Examples of Likely Closed Detention Facilities To demonstrate the types of visible indicators of closure seen in satellite imagery, two examples are presented below. Figure Three shows imagery and nighttime lighting data from a Tier 1 reeducation center in Hotan Prefecture we assess to be no longer operational. Nighttime lighting data show this facility experienced significant growth throughout 2017, with sustained levels of electricity consumption through late 2018. This correlates with evidence of major construction at this facility over the same time period seen in overhead imagery (not shown), as well as construction seen at two adjacent detention facilities. But by September 2018, satellite imagery reveals that the vast majority of this facility had been demolished, leaving only two buildings on the eastern portion of the camp. As a result, and based upon similar evidence of demolition seen in the facilities adjacent to this camp, we assess that this\u00a0reeducation center is no longer operational. Figure Three.

The left image is from Google Earth, 2017. The right image is from copyright Digital Globe, 2020.  A second example is shown below in Figure Four. Despite the large spike in nighttime lighting seen in early 2015, most of this reeducation center in Ili Prefecture appears to have been constructed in early 2018 based upon satellite imagery (not shown). The facility appears to have been fully operational as of at least September 2018, with imagery from this time shown in the left panel of the figure below. Overall, this reeducation center is comprised of roughly half a dozen buildings inside a secured compound, and adjacent to what appears to be a driving school. Dozens of cars are also seen parked on the road outside the gate, potentially belonging to the workers at this facility given that they are concentrated near its entrance. Figure Four.

Imagery from copyright Digital Globe, 2018 and 2020.  At some point between December 2018 and August 2019, overhead imagery shows that internal fencing and watchtowers surrounding the main buildings within this facility were removed. And by January 2020 (as shown in the right-hand panel above), the facility appears to be no longer operational. One building in the southeast corner has been demolished, and while snow has clearly been plowed on nearby roads and adjacent infrastructure, little effort has been made to clear snow from the roads, walkways, and common areas within this facility. Moreover, in this image as well as others taken soon before and well after this image, almost no vehicles are seen parked outside the front gate on the road outside this facility. Taken together with the overall decline in nighttime lighting seen during this time period, we assess that this facility is likely no longer operational. For the remaining 40 facilities experiencing major declines in nighttime lighting, our analysis revealed little evidence consistent with potential closure. In some cases, we simply found no clear evidence either way to suggest a change in operating status, and default to ASPI's assessment that these camps were once operational, and therefore have likely remained so. In other cases, overhead imagery shows affirmative evidence that detention facilities remain operational despite their declining nighttime lighting. One such example, shown below in Figure Five, is a low-security reeducation center in Ili Prefecture in northwestern Xinjiang. Despite a major period of decline in nighttime lighting throughout 2019 and early 2020, satellite imagery from May 2020 shows clear evidence of human activity in the courtyard of this facility. Specifically, three separate lines or queues of people can be seen forming out of the southern entrance to the main building of facility. Overall, the facility is well-maintained, and a new controlled entry point was built on the southern end between April and October 2019. While speculative, the entrance may have been relocated from the main artery (Route 315), to a smaller, less accessible side street that is easier to control, secure, and monitor traffic flow.

Imagery from copyright Digital Globe, 2017 and 2020.  Key Takeaways This report summarizes the results of RAND's systematic assessment of the operating status of Xinjiang detention facilities. Overall, we find that only 13 percent of detention facilities in Xinjiang experienced major declines in nighttime lighting in recent years that may suggest closure. Moreover, once satellite imagery data are layered on top of this analysis, we find that just 3 percent of detention facilities in Xinjiang show clear evidence consistent with closure of these facilities. These findings cast further doubt upon official Chinese government claims to have ceased or relaxed efforts to reeducate, detain, and imprison Uyghur and other ethnic minority populations in Xinjiang. Of note, ASPI's original investigation into these 380 facilities concluded that eight facilities showed evidence of decommissioning based solely upon overhead imagery \u2013 a roughly\u00a0comparable estimate. However, our analysis suggests that only five of the eight facilities deemed decommissioned by ASPI are likely closed. For the cases in which we differ, our nighttime lighting estimates suggest that these facilities remain operational. And yet, ASPI's determination that such facilities were decommissioned appears to have been based, in part, on such facilities changing purpose (e.g. from a\u00a0prison to a reeducation center), rather than closing down for good.

Imagery from copyright Digital Globe, 2017 and 2020  Looking Ahead This report, the second in a series of three, used nighttime lighting and satellite imagery data to systematically assess the current operating status of known Uyghur and ethnic minority detention facilities in Xinjiang, and revealed that less than three percent of these facilities exhibit clear signs of potential closure. Our final report in this series will explore macro-level trends in the growth and decline of specific types of facilities across Xinjiang, to help better assess the future trajectory of China\u2019s widespread detention of Uyghur and ethnic minority populations in the region.  Things To Watch What factors explain the varied growth and decline of different types of detention facilities in Xinjiang?  Can overhead satellite imagery provide further insight into the operating status of other detention facilities experiencing only partial declines in nighttime lighting? Can other forms of geospatial data be used to validate these results?

While site visits are a practice consistent with the past, Kim\u2019s hands-on approach for major projects is an emerging signature of his leadership.  Kim\u2019s guidance over the construction of the Wonsan Beach Resort serves as a case study of his leadership style and preferences. For signature projects like this, Kim is hands-on, if not heavy-handed in his direction, allowing for a certain level of trial and error until the outcome meets his expectations\u2014all while making sure to praise the workers for their tireless efforts and sacrifices.  Activity GEOINT analysis show construction spikes in May 2019 after an April 2019 visit from Kim but significantly slowed construction from September 2019 to March 2020.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  Kim Jong Un has exhibited an agility in his leadership, separate from that of his predecessors. Kim has shown the ability to shift overall state policy direction from his father's songun policy of military first, to his own byungjin policy of simultaneous economic and nuclear development, to a more economy-focused policy in recent years. Throughout his tenure, he has also shown a preference for being hands-on for high priority projects, whether overseeing multiple missile tests or guiding the course of major construction projects, to ensure his goals are accomplished.1 The development of the Wonsan-Kalma Coastal Tourism Area (the Wonsan Beach Resort) reflects this emerging pattern of Kim's leadership. While the Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang International Tourism Zone was formalized in 2014, Kim did not push the construction of the coastal area until 2018, when prospects for better external relations, possible sanctions easing and a large influx of tourism were high. Once the coastal area became a high priority, Kim pushed the construction of this project at a remarkable pace. Making four site visits within a year, Kim's heavy-handed approach led to multiple course changes along the way, showing a preference for style over speed, wanting the job done right, not just quickly. However, when changes in the external environment made large-scale tourism unlikely in the near term, Kim's priorities once again shifted, leaving the Wonsan Beach Resort a longer-term goal and diverting resources to projects that better serve the country's needs at a time of hardship. Background The Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang International Tourist Zone is a large-scale tourist zone located along the southeastern coast of North Korea. It was officially announced in June 2014, although plans had been in place to develop this zone long before that time. It was intended to be the country's top destination for both domestic and foreign vacationers, complete with world-class resort amenities and entertainment. Rich in natural attractions, the area includes miles of beaches, snowy mountains and breathtaking waterfalls, providing would-be tourists with year-round enjoyment. Moreover, its location was ideal, with two hours of flying time from major cities in China, Russia and Japan and situated at a railway junction with service to Dandong, China via Pyongyang, and to Khasan, Russia via Hamhung and Chongjin.2 Spanning over 400 square kilometers, the zone consists of six districts: Wonsan, Masikryong Ski Resort, Ullim Falls, Sogwang Temple, Thongchon, and Mt. Kumgang.3 The coastal area beach resort was meant to be the centerpiece, with plans for it to accommodate up to 100,000 guests at a time, replete with sports and leisure amenities and an international conference center. Despite Kim Jong Un's vision in 2013 and 2014 to open numerous special economic zones around the country, few have come to fruition. Plans for the Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang International Tourism Zone have not only survived, but seem to have grown in importance over the years, having been mentioned in four of Kim Jong Un's New Year Addresses since 2015. Early Development of the Wonsan-Kalma Coastal Tourism Area Construction on the beach resort, a roughly 5 km stretch of beach in the Wonsan-Kalma Coastal Tourism Area, reportedly began in 2014. However, little if any work was actually observed at that time. The north end of the peninsula had four hotels and seven beachfront cottages that predated plans to transform the area into a tourist zone, which remained the same for a few years. Kim Jong Un called for the acceleration of economic zone development, specifically the Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang International Tourist Zone, in his 2015 New Year Address, but nothing changed at beach resort until 2018. After a year of heightened tensions spurred on by North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile testing and US hardline responses of \"fire and fury,\" Kim Jong Un began 2018 on a much different note. In his New Year Address, he highlighted the country's achievements in the nuclear realm but then offered an opening to inter-Korean diplomacy. In that speech, he also called for re-energized economic development efforts, reviving discussion of the Wonsan zone. He stated: \"This year the service personnel and people should join efforts to complete the construction of the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist area in the shortest period of time.\" As such, construction efforts began in earnest in January 2018 as large workers' camps were erected at the south end of the airport and in an area adjacent to the commercial air terminal. Over the next few months roads were graded, building foundations excavated, a new marina prepared, and construction began on a possible future ferry terminal. By April, imagery revealed what would be the full layout of the resort complex, beginning from the original beach cottages and extending approximately four kilometers to the south. As construction picked up, then-Premier Pak Pong Ju made two site visits to the project site, in February and April, ahead of a visit from the leader. May 2018: \"New Miracles\" Kim Jong Un's first site visit to the Wonsan Beach Resort was in May 2018. He noted then \"that new miracles in construction are being created again at the construction site of the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist area.\" While praising workers for the progress made over the last several months, he also addressed the hastened efforts, stating that feasible construction schedules and project safety were necessary to ensure high-quality building construction. Additionally, Kim urged nationwide mobilization to provide equipment and increase production of building materials for the Wonsan-Kalma project. Kim instructed builders to complete the resort in less than a year, setting the target for opening by April 15, 2019, the \"Day of the Sun\" (which commemorates Kim Il Sung's birthday). By July 2018, more than 100 buildings were under construction including an assortment of hotels, condos and other resort facilities, at least 40 of which were multi-story structures. Just north of the beach cottages, construction on the new marina for pleasure craft moved rapidly, installing a concrete quay with six finger piers and a protective jetty. A beach-front promenade extending the length of the resort was being prepared, several entertainment venues were distinguishable along a street paralleling the promenade, and a large sports complex featuring a soccer field enclosed by a track, a small stadium, and outdoor Olympic-size lane and diving pools were under construction. August 2018: Changes in Direction During his second visit in August 2018, Kim called for some fairly major redesigns, showing a preference for style over the original push for \"Masikryong Speed.\" For example, he expressed a desire for more variety of building designs, and more taller buildings 25 to 30 stories high. He also wanted the aesthetic to be more \"harmonious\" and \"peculiar,\" to create a more interesting and artistic look to the resort.4 Kim also offered instruction on landscape design and public features, \"for artificial ponds to match their surroundings and to have angling sites, and for first aid stations to be placed around the resort.\" During this visit, he ordered the construction of a water park to be presented as a gift to the people by October 10, 2019. KCNA reported that Kim had \"a big smile on his face\" as he envisaged that \"Myongsasipri (4-kilometer beautiful sand) is likely to become Inpasipri (4-kilometer tide of people).\" Between his August and October visits, the Olympic-size pool complex was removed and ground scarring began for new construction in its place. Several other new foundations were laid for additional high-rise buildings reflecting Kim's new instructions. October 2018: Course Corrections Despite making major changes to the resort design, Kim visited a third time in October 2018 and expressed continued dissatisfaction with the aesthetics of the resort layout, stating \"the whole street was not perfect in the artistic aspect\" and \"high and low buildings were not combined in a harmonious way.\"5 He demanded additional changes, calling for a new government and management complex to be integrated into the center of the resort, along with more arcades, an all-event stadium, movie houses and a large water park and funfair. He tasked officials to build new parking structures, renovate the Kalma train station, and study how to improve public transportation in the area. Kim again adjusted the deadline to allow for these course corrections and moved the target date for the whole resort, not just the water park, to October 10, 2019, the Foundation Day of the Korean Workers' Party. By November, preparations for a new water park were afoot at the southern end of the resort. Moreover, by the end of December, several buildings were nearing completion, many of which had been redesigned to display more unique attributes. New buildings were still being added while landscaping and beautification efforts were underway, installing formal gardens and beach-side parks. The faux-island resort hotel replaced the Olympic-size swim and dive pools at the sports complex area, with a series of over-the-water cottages lining part of a newly-formed lake.6 This rapid, large-scale development was punctuated by diplomatic efforts in 2018, including three summits with Chinese leader Xi Jinping (March, May and June), two inter-Korean summits (April and September) and the first ever summit with a US president in June. In his August and October 2018 visits to Wonsan, Kim positioned the progress and future success of the Wonsan-Kalma tourist area as an empowering project defiant in the face of \"hostile forces\" impeding the people's happiness through \"vicious\" and \"brigandish\" sanctions.7 April 2019: Progress Turns to Plateau Kim Jong Un returned to the resort in April 2019, his fourth visit in less than a year, and liked what he saw, noting that prior shortcomings had been addressed, and commenting how the street formation looked \"elegant artistically\" and that the area was now \"spectacular.\"8 Pleased with the design, Kim praised builders for working through the winter \"changing the appearance of the construction site beyond recognition\" and turned his attention to the resort's accessibility.9 He told project managers there was a need for a tram line on the promenade, bicycle baths, electric cars, floating piers, and park benches. As a result, the opening of the resort was pushed back yet again, this time to April 15, 2020. State media reported the postponed deadline, reinforcing the notion of quality over speed, explaining builders should not push forward the construction \"in haste,\" but take until the next Day of the Sun to \"perfectly finish it.\"10 Imagery from May revealed once again dramatic and remarkable changes in the wake of Kim's April visit. The marina and associated buildings appeared to be nearing completion and the paving of the main quay area had begun. Several stories were added to multiple high-rises, building exteriors were nearing completion, promenades and streets appeared finished, and beautification efforts continued throughout the site. By late September, all of the tower hotels along the beach appeared to be either complete or nearing completion with finishing roof work and landscaping efforts underway. Despite this progress, Kim did not return to inspect the beach resort in 2019, even though he was reportedly in the area on occasion, including to watch the Combat Flight Contest in November. Relations with the US had been rocky since the failure to reach an initial agreement at the Hanoi Summit in February 2019, and despite a couple subsequent interactions, working-level talks had been unsuccessful in moving the relationship forward. The optimism of 2018 for better external relations to lead to near term economic opportunities had faded and both US-DPRK and inter-Korean relations had returned to the status quo. Pivot to Pyongyang From late September 2019 to March 2020, the pace of construction significantly slowed at Wonsan. Despite no formal announcement delaying the opening of the Wonsan Beach Resort, it was clear the deadline would not be met. While sanctions are believed to have hindered the sourcing of necessary finishing materials, the new year brought with it a new problem: the emergence of a pandemic. Once confirmed that COVID-19 had spread outside of China, North Korea quickly responded with drastic decisions. Unlike other countries that employed more gradual containment measures, North Korea shut down its borders, suspending all cross-border traffic and trade, flights, and tourism, accompanied with several anti-epidemic quarantine measures for both incoming and domestic audiences. Work continues at the site, although on a relatively minor scale compared to the past two years. The size of the workers' villages has decreased, with resources and personnel presumably diverted to other major construction projects such as the Pyongyang General Hospital, an ambitious undertaking to build a multi-tower complex within 200 days. While some finishing work has been observed at Wonsan in recent months, significant work remains, especially on the leisure facilities and Kim's requested parking and transportation-related amenities. Reports have placed Kim Jong Un in the Wonsan area several times this year, but he has neither returned to the beach resort nor addressed the missed deadline. He did, however, issue one statement on April 27 thanking various workers and offices by name for their contributions to the construction of the Wonsan-Kalma project, including preparing materials, boosting morale, and providing first aid in the field. State media still occasionally reports on Wonsan, noting ongoing interior work and mass planting of flora underway in March, and a May report that the electric cars Kim had ordered had been received.11,12 Given the current political environment and ongoing pandemic, Kim's attention may not return to Wonsan in the near term. In fact, Voice of Korea recently reported that builders from the beach resort have been diverted to help with flood damage rehabilitation efforts in Phangyo County of the Kangwon Province, presumably slowing resort construction efforts even further for the time being. While Kim has invested a lot of personal time and energy in the success of this project, focus on its completion is unlikely to resume until prospects improve for large-scale tourism. Conclusion The frequency of Kim Jong Un's site visits (or lack thereof) to a particular place is an obvious indicator as to the priority it holds, especially in the context of the times. Due to limited resources, usually only one or two major construction projects on the scale of the Wonsan Beach Resort are undertaken at any given point in time. While speed has been a major indicator of success for previous projects, Kim has shown an emphasis for aesthetics and quality, modifying deadlines to accommodate course corrections. Furthermore, he has proven to be hands-on for high priority projects, and demonstrated a certain level of trial and error until the outcome matches his expectations. In doing so, he does not blame the workers when the project falls short of his vision. Instead, he consistently lavishes praise on the workers and their dedication to the project. The Wonsan Beach Resort has suffered setbacks due to drastic changes in the country's external environment and urgency for completion has faded for now. But as COVID containment measures start to ease the prospects for tourism rise again, Kim's time and attention to this project will likely return as well. References and Notes 1. For example, Kim Jong Un conducted ten site visits to the Samjiyon City construction project from November 2013-December 2019; he visited the Yangdok Hot Spring Resort six times from August 2018-December 2019 for field guidance, inspections and the opening ceremony; and he visited the Pyongyang General Hospital twice during its 200-day construction push, the first in March 2020 for its groundbreaking ceremony, and later in July to provide field guidance. 2.

The Wonsan Beach Resort is a good example of these shifting priorities and a push for more than just speed.  Things To Watch When does Kim Jong Un\u2019s attention turn back to Wonsan\/what triggers that shift of resources? What sites does Kim frequent more, are there certain sectors that are visited more frequently? What are the conditions under which Kim prioritizes speed versus quality or aesthetics? Do greater patterns emerge? If Kim is averse to criticizing workers, who does he blame when projects under his supervision do not meet his expectations?

Further, industrial clusters and companies in the zone appear to be guided by the MIC25's ten core industries. Imagery analysis indicates increases in human activity and construction from 2015 to 2020. However, this activity is largely associated with more traditional, \"low-tech\" activity, in contrast to the MIC25 focus on more \"high-tech\" development. This finding proves that the area is in use, but does not disprove the existence of \"high-tech\" development which is largely unidentifiable via imagery analysis, especially radar imagery analysis.  Activity This Tearline article from William &amp; Mary's geoLab is the first in a series of reports analyzing China's Made in China 2025 (MIC25) policy's interactions with Chinese industrial parks. This report examines the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area utilizing radar imagery, electro-optical imagery, and text-based data.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  Introduction: Made in China 2025\u00a0 With the \"Opening of China\" in 1978, China laid a new foundation for its rapid economic expansion. New incentives for the construction, improvement, and operation of industrial parks, in particular, played an important role. Such parks concentrate human and fiscal capital in order to help reduce the cost of transportation, communications, and logistics; thus, allowing for the free exchange of knowledge, leading to greater efficiency, and profits. Since the creation of its first industrial park in the mid-1980s, China has successfully built and operated over 1,400 large industrial parks. According to MIT analysis, these parks provide for over 40% of the country's manufacturing jobs and account for roughly 10% of China's GDP. China's industrial parks are a key aspect of its economy, and the government takes measures to ensure the competitive strength and capabilities of its domestic firms.\u00a0 Introduced in 2015, the Made in China 2025 (MIC25) policy aims to further develop the manufacturing sector of the Chinese economy. This policy seeks to move China from the world's factory to a powerhouse of technology-intensive goods, specifically seeking to strengthen China's financial, education, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors by investing in technological innovation and smart manufacturing. This policy shift would reduce China's reliance on foreign technology imports, allowing the state to become more self-sufficient. So far, Chinese state-owned enterprises, domestic companies, and international companies have all invested in MIC25 industries in China. But, the plan's implementation relies on Chinese government policy including favorable taxes, market access to policies to incentivize foreign firms to move research and development efforts\u00a0to China, forced joint ventures between foreign and Chinese domestic firms, government subsidies for domestic firms engaging in research and development, and talent recruitment for Chinese firms. Figure Caption: The MIC25 Policy focuses on ten industries: advanced information technology, automated machine tools, and robotics, aerospace and aeronautical equipment, ocean engineering equipment and high-tech shipping, modern rail transport equipment, energy-saving and new energy vehicles, power equipment, resource extraction, medicine and medical devices, and agricultural equipment. Source of Figure: MERICS. China aims to promote the industries included in MIC25 over the next 30 years through a comprehensive three-phased plan. This first phase, initiated in 2015, plans to \"boost domestic manufacturing quality, innovation, and labor productivity; obtain an advanced level of technology integration; reduce energy and resource consumption, and develop globally competitive firms and industrial centers.\" The second phase concludes in 2035, with goals of reaching parity with global industry and setting global standards. The final phase concludes in 2049, the centennial of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and plans to set China to be the leader in global manufacturing and innovation. These policies have received considerable backlash from the international community, specifically the United States, for providing Chinese firms with an unfair advantage in global markets. China responded in 2018, downplaying its initial ambitions for global leadership. In 2019, in the opening session of the National People's Congress, Premier Li Keqiang did not mention MIC25 at all, this being the first time he left the policy out of his annual report to congress. In this report, we explore the degree to which MIC25 influences industrial parks in China through a case study of the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area. Using a mixed-methods approach (satellite imagery and text analysis), we explore the time period from 2016 to 2020, seeking to identify both where and to what degree physical construction or change may have taken place.\u00a0 We find significant signals of change, but note that the most clearly defined signals are associated with large-scale \"low-tech\" manufacturing. The radar satellite data easily picks up this larger, more traditional, \"low-tech\" activity in the zone, as opposed to identifying more \"high-tech\" development which MIC25 focuses on. However, radar imagery analysis alone has limited explanatory power which we will caveat and explain in the methodology section.\u00a0 Methodology Our team, based out of the geoLab at William & Mary, utilized Chinese government material for the policy information, online company profiles of businesses in the zone, open mapping services, and press reporting. Some of this information was geospatially evaluated utilizing geographical information systems (GIS) integrating both electro-optical commercial imagery and open synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data.\u00a0 We created an activity and change alerting and detection service within Google Earth Engine, using open synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected by Sentinel-1. This SAR activity\/change service works by detecting changes in radar backscatter over time caused by moving vehicles, construction activity, or natural phenomena. The change in backscatter over time was analyzed to identify areas of increased economic activity (for more details, you can read an earlier Tearline article that leveraged similar SAR techniques). In our images, the areas in bright reds signify the highest amount of activity that occurred over the five-year timeframe of 2016 to 2020. Key Assumption This article works under the assumption and defines \"low tech\" manufacturing as more traditional manufacturing such as car manufacturing where substantial activity can be measured throughout the facility, especially from our SAR detection service.\u00a0 In comparison, we define \"high tech\" as industries where more activity takes place under the roof of the facility and thus limits some measurements of activity from overhead imagery sources, especially our SAR detection service. For example, \"high tech\" would include chip manufacturing, biomedical research, and robotics where most activity takes place under the roof with light activity outside from parking. Sample of the SAR script running inside Google Earth Engine.  Overview: the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area The Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area is located to the southeast of Beijing, approximately 16.5 kilometers from Beijing's city center. Since its founding in 1992, the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area has transformed from a large plot of farming land into an innovative industrial zone - attracting investment from 4,000 companies from 30 different countries. Since 2015, following the direction of the MIC25 policy, public announcements suggest that the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area has placed its full attention on advancing high-tech industries. Manufacturing of certain consumer products, printing, machinery, and chemical industries are being phased out making greater room for high-tech manufacturing. In 2016, the Chinese Communist Party launched a new Action Plan for Faster Development in the Southern Part of Beijing (Action Plan), covering the Thirteenth Plan that established the MIC25 Policy. The Action Plan emphasizes development that improves the standards of living for the urban populace and strengthens China's technology commercialization, reform, innovation, and opening up of the economy. To support the Beijing platform, as well as the MIC25 plan, the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area has formed a holistic industry ecology with four central industrial focuses:\u00a0 1. Next-generation IT 2. New energy 3. Intelligent vehicle, biotechnology and big health 4. Robotics and intelligent manufacturing\u00a0 The interactive map, shown in the image below and accessible via the link, shows the makeup of the zone. We highlight a number of key industrial clusters within the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, including the Hongda Industrial Park, which focuses on biomedical research, and the Aerospace Science and Technology Park Zone A, which focuses on aerospace. For more information about the analyzed\u00a0industrial clusters, see this ownloadable file. Both of the two aforementioned industrial clusters have manufacturing concentrations which are emphasized by the MIC25 policy. Other industrial clusters in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area\u00a0contain a large number of companies specializing in various areas such as electronics, biomedicine, real estate, robotics, investment management, etc. The Action Plan parallels the MIC25 policy by creating criteria for businesses to move into the industrial parks, including requirements on \"industry types, investment intensity, output efficiency... innovation capacity, and energy conservation and environmental standards.\" Land use priority has been given to southern Beijing for new development projects, including within the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area. Since information about companies and clusters in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area is incomplete, we cannot make a conclusion about which kind of industry is most prevalent. However, evidence from the text-based material supports the theory that MIC25, aided by the Action Plan, is - at least on paper - fulfilling its stated goal of upgrading China\u2019s manufacturing to more \"high-tech\" industries.\u00a0 SAR data collected by the Sentinel-1 and analyzed with our SAR script allows for further analysis of change over time and can help to fill gaps when on-the-ground reporting is lacking or incomplete. By measuring the amount of radar backscatter, we can infer changes in activity on the ground. The below image compares backscatter levels from January 2016 to December 2020, or the first five-year period of the MIC25 plan. The bright red indicates that a significant amount of activity (i.e., a positive change in total backscatter) has occurred over the selected time period. As the below image shows, substantial changes and activity occurred throughout the zone during this time interval.\u00a0 This indicates an increase in the total amount of man-made items that are in the zone -- which also supports the MIC25.\u00a0 High-Tech vs Low-Tech Manufacturing in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area SAR data analysis indicates mixed construction and human activity throughout the park. Change did not happen at the same rate across the entire period explored. Contrasting to a baseline period of 2015, the 2016 SAR data analysis revealed minimal activity in the zone, potentially corresponding to MIC25 taking time to significantly impact construction timelines. The sole major cluster of activity is centered around the Beijing, Benz Automotive Co., Ltd. factory, a Mercedes factory inside the development area. This is reflected in electro-optical imagery as well, which reveals that the factory was only in the early stages of construction in 2015. For more context, the company itself was founded in 2005 and was operational at the time, just on a smaller scale.\u00a0 The lack of satellite imagery evidence of high-tech industry growth is not in and of itself surprising. For example, refurbishing the interior of existing structures can be a cost-effective alternative to building from scratch.\u00a0 However, the dominance of low-tech industries in this analysis is of note - and is further reflected in official communications. Official Chinese government sources for the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area highlight the number of non-Chinese top companies which operate in the zone, including the German Mercedes Benz, indicating that the economic success of the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area is partially dependent on foreign investment and foreign firms. Further, the factory has increased its alignment with MIC25 over time as the factory, according to the company's webpage, focuses on \"digital, flexible, efficient and sustainable\" manufacturing and strives to transform China's domestic automobile industry. This is complemented by increased production output and statements on potential plans to focus primarily on electric cars. The geographic regions of development within the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area both increased and shifted over time. In 2016, we saw the most intensive material investments in a single location, with activity in the aforementioned Mercedes factory dominating new material events. The trend of growth in \"low-tech\" and infrastructure-heavy industries continued through 2017, though in 2018, further change was visible at both the Mercedes factory and the nearby highway, Boxing Road. However, the below satellite imagery shows minimal physical changes to Boxing Road. Instead, the activity change picked up by the SAR script is increased automobile traffic to and from reach the Mercedes factory while expanding. In contrast to the bright red spots throughout these \"low-tech\" or infrastructure-heavy industries in the SAR data, the industrial clusters with more emphasis on \"high-tech\" industries showed muted activity under the roof but light activity adjacent to the facility. This visible activity in the SAR data around the \"high-tech\" industries is most likely due to routine car parking. In contrast, SAR data of the \"low-tech\" areas indicates activity throughout the majority of the area.\u00a0 We analyzed all industrial clusters and each one showed this phenomenon. The Beijing Yizhuang Biomedical Park, located in the Northeast portion\u00a0of the zone and shown in the below image, was chosen as the example because biotechnology and biomedicine are both at the heart of MIC25 and one the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area's four pillars. We believe that most \"high-tech\" industry and activity emphasized by the MIC25 occurs indoors, which satellites cannot detect. Thus, our understanding of the role of these \"high-tech\" industrial clusters is mostly limited to text-based intelligence.\u00a0 In 2020, based on analysis of SAR data, it does not appear that the park's construction or operation was significantly impacted by COVID-19 which forced Beijing into a months-long lockdown. No specific location in the zone stands out, indicating more construction and continued human activity in the park. The level of activity in 2020 is similar to that of 2019, as revealed by the SAR data.\u00a0 Residential Changes in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area In 2014, the Chinese Communist Party announced the policy of \"new-type urbanization,\" or a more sustainable and balanced form of urbanization. According to press reporting, the Chinese Government has been pursuing policies that will move over 250 million rural citizens into newly constructed towns and cities. The ultimate goal of the government's policies is to fully integrate 70% of the country's population, or roughly 900 million people, into urban areas by 2025. Over time, as the planning theory goes, the rural population, through the urbanization of rural areas or resettlement to urban areas, will have access to greater educational opportunities and healthcare thus adding to the higher-skilled labor pool. In theory, creating such cities in conjunction with industrial parks allows for more local housing and public transport to better integrate the community and thus greater economic prosperity. Industrial parks in China have become an important tool to promote greater economic development and urbanization. While MIC25 does not explicitly talk about increased urbanization, it does emphasize that industrial parks are interwoven with residential areas. This intermingling of land use is visible in the interactive map and ownloadable data, which highlights residential zones in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area. In the 2019 SAR data, a spot in the Eastern part of the park showed up in bright red. Upon further investigation with electro-optical imagery, we noticed high-rise apartments located in close proximity to industrial areas. Imagery analysis also showed evidence that a village was razed to make way for the companies and apartments. While there is no local press or social media information available regarding citizens\u2019 reactions to these changes and forced resettlement, there has been widespread external reporting about this phenomenon in China. Prior to MIC25 and the area's designation as an industrial park, the zone was mostly\u00a0farmland. In line with China's urbanization and industrial policies, the zone has quickly developed, a change that has impacted those who previously occupied the zone. The New York Times reported that large-scale programs across China move farmers into housing towers, with the farmers' plots given to corporations or municipalities. For instance, the state-owned Beijing E-town International Investment & Development Co., Ltd. funded the Yongkang Apartment project\u00a0that is set to house over 6,000 employees newly relocated to the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area.\u00a0 SAR data analysis shows that residential zones are changing in structure to allow for more urbanization since the announcement of the MIC25 and China's 2014 urbanization policy. These changes have the potential to impact the demographics of the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area and uproot communities. While MIC25 focuses on industrial development, this is intertwined with urban development and demographic shifts because increased construction and new industries are both reliant on local workers. Green Infrastructure and Spaces in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area MIC25's core industrial focuses emphasize the need for clean energy and more energy-efficient technologies. Further, the MIC25 laid out targets for companies to have a 35%\u00a0decline in energy and water consumption per unit of added value by 2025. This sustainability push is in line with China's policies and declarations against climate change as the nation recently announced its plan to be carbon neutral by 2060. In terms of environmental protection, industrial parks provide a setting for initiatives such as improved waste collection and treatment, research and development in water purification, and carbon emissions measurement and indicator systems. In line with these policies, the Chinese government\u00a0has not only placed its interest in advanced high-tech industries that will provide long-term growth opportunities for the area, but also invested in the goal of becoming a sustainable city. Beijing's 2013 - 2017 Clean Air Action Plan cut the PM2.5 (particle pollution) by 38%. According to a private company working with the zone, the action plan has made progress in reducing emissions from coal, vehicles, industrial stacks, and dust.\u00a0 Along with these strides, the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area has made significant improvements to the local water system. By integrating the area's water flows by combining tap water, rainwater, underground water, sewage water, and already recycled water into a single system, the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area has greatly improved cyclical water utilization and limited waste. According to a private company working with the zone, the development area has a 100% sewage water treatment rate and reclaimed water use is currently 30% of total water consumption. The conservation of water has allowed for greater green areas. According to a German state-owned funder involved in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, seven large-scale green park projects have been completed, covering an area of 18,000 hectares. The creation of these green spaces or wetland parks is visible in both the satellite imagery and SAR\u00a0 data. Located towards the center of the zone, SAR data analysis identified the Beijing Yizhuang Wetland Park as a major spot of activity and green space development. As demonstrated in the 2017, 2018, and 2021 images, the buildings located in the area were de-constructed so the land could be dedicated to this space. To test whether this was a one-off occurrence or a trend, we analyzed global land use data. Utilizing 2015 land use data from the Global Land Use Database and 2020 land use data from ESRI, we determined that approximately 34.8984 square kilometers transitioned from built-up surfaces to green spaces. Further, 11.6379 square kilometers transitioned from other surfaces to water. This shows that the Beijing Yizhuang Wetland Park is part of a trend towards more green spaces due to the conservation of water in the park. Further, it exemplifies the significant impact MIC25 has had on the layout and activity occurring throughout the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area. To produce these statistics, we first standardized the two raster land cover datasets to both be a 30 square meter resolution and have the same values associated with land cover categories. The land cover categories were simplified to: water, impervious surfaces (representing built areas), bareland (usually representing land in transition), and green spaces (representing grass, forests, etc.). Utilizing the raster calculator in ArcGIS Pro we were able to analyze the land-use changes between the datasets, which is represented in the map above. The water statistic was the sum of counts of all surfaces becoming water (12,931), multiplied by 30 square meters (11,637,900), and converted to square kilometers (11.6379). The green space statistic was calculated by first subtracting the amount of green spaces which became impervious surfaces (81,827) from the amount of impervious surfaces which became green spaces (120,607). This statistic (38,780) was then multiplied by 30 square meters (34,898,400) and converted to square kilometers (34.8984).

However, development in the park reaffirms MIC25 goals. Activity in the park reflects the policy priorities of MIC25: talent recruitment, foreign investment, and green development. Imagery analysis suggests significant development has taken place in the park since the launch of MIC25 with a focus on education, research & development, and biotech & pharmaceuticals. Activity This Tearline article is part of a three-part series analyzing China's Made in China 2025 (MIC25) policy's interactions with Chinese industrial parks. This report examines the Zhangjiang High-Tech Industrial Park utilizing radar imagery, electro-optical imagery, GIS data, and text-based data. In addition to the MIC25-connection thesis, this report serves as a baseline on the history, composition, and expansion of the park. Article  Timeline  Graphs  Introduction: Made in China 2025 Published in 2015, China's Made in China 2025 (MIC25) policy seeks to transform China's manufacturing sector by decreasing China's reliance on foreign technology imports, creating a more self-sufficient state. The influence and implementation of MIC25 is reflected in the expansion of high-tech industrial parks on the mainland. In this series, we explore MIC25's policy influence on Chinese high-tech industrial parks, including Beijing, Shenzhen, and in this case study: Shanghai's Zhangjiang High-Tech Industrial Park. This study aims to evaluate the extent to which MIC25 policies influence industrial development in the park. We will refer to this tech park as the Zhangjiang Park throughout the rest of the study. In line with MIC25's goals and policies, prevalent industries in Zhangjiang Park focus on developing human talent, advancing research and development, and expanding infrastructure for science and technology. However, this development began prior to the release of MIC25, suggesting that the goal of turning Zhangjiang Park into a premier research and development hub predated this national policy yet aligns with the goals. Methodology Our team, based out of the geoLab at William & Mary, utilized Chinese policy information, online company profiles of businesses in the zone, open mapping services, and press reporting to identify physical construction and foundational changes and the policy and reporting information connected to these changes. Some of this information was evaluated utilizing geographic information systems (GIS), integrating both electro-optical commercial imagery and open synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to evaluate activity in the park. Imagery analysis is used to confirm or refute Chinese claims in open reporting or business literature that can be fragmented, opaque, or exaggerated. We created an activity and change alerting and detection service within Google Earth Engine, using open synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected by Sentinel-1, collected from a satellite operated by the European Space Agency. This SAR activity\/change service works by detecting changes in radar backscatter over time caused by moving vehicles, construction activity, or natural phenomena. The change in backscatter over time was analyzed to identify areas of increased economic activity (for more details, you can read an earlier Tearline article that leveraged similar SAR techniques). Figure 1: Sentinel-1 Imagery snapshot of Zhangjiang Park (2016-2022) with three smaller High-Tech Industrial Parks outlined in white. Overview: Zhangjiang High-Tech Industrial Park Figure 3: Clearing of land and development in Zhangjiang Park, in both commercial and Sentinel-1 imagery. According to the Chinese government, Zhangjiang has over 18,000 enterprises. Although a comprehensive list of these enterprises is not readily available, disparate reporting suggests the park includes 685 high-tech enterprises, 403 Research & Development institutions, and nearly 20 universities and research institutes as of 2020. According to the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone, a regional free trade zone that encompasses Zhangjiang Park, the park&#x27;s leading industries are information technology, bio-medicine, cultural creativity, and low-carbon and environmental protection. The park also contains the regional R&D headquarters of seven of the top ten global pharmaceutical companies, reported by Sina Corporation, a Chinese technology company. This focus helped China's pharmaceutical market become the world's third-largest market. Geospatial and text-based analysis of the pharmaceutical industry in Zhangjiang Park is addressed later in this study. Zhangjiang Park has a broader mission of developing and fostering talent including attracting and incentivizing the return of Chinese students who study abroad. Industrial Focuses of Zhangjiang High-Tech Park: Science & Technology Zhangjiang Park is described as \u201cChina's Silicon Valley\" by domestic Chinese sources and park promoters, namely Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, an \"industrial research foundation,\" and the Global Times, a Chinese tabloid newspaper. In the information technology field, Zhangjiang is home to the \u201cmost complete integrated circuit industrial chain\u201d in China, according to China Daily, an English-language newspaper run by the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party. Further, China Daily reports that six of the top 10 global chip design companies have prioritized relocating their regional headquarters and research and development centers to Zhangjiang. Emerging science and technology buildings present in satellite imagery below confirm these Chinese source declarations. Medical Research and Biopharmaceuticals Sina Corporation reports that seven of the top ten global pharmaceutical companies have regional R&D headquarters in Zhangjiang Park, which emphasizes the relevance of the park in this global industry. The Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, pictured in Figure 4, is one prominent medical research facility in the park that advances science and technology innovation. A synchrotron facility generates light that is typically used in medical and technological research by accelerating electrons almost to the speed of light. According to Diamond Light Source, the UK's national synchrotron, this facility is one of only 70 \u2014 in various stages of development \u2014 globally. Figure 7: Sentinel-1 imagery of the industrial park bordering Guoshoujing Road. The Shanghai Biopharmaceutical Industrial Base, pictured in Figure 8, is a pharmaceutical facility that focuses on foreign investment and education. The base is located in the center of Zhangjiang Park and was established shortly after Zhangjiang Park in 1996. This area is dubbed by the Pudong government as Zhangjiang's Pharma Valley. According to Asia Pacific Biotech News, which is owned by World Scientific and headquartered in Singapore, the base is broken up into four sections with varying objectives, which are as follows: 1. To \u201cattract other local and foreign enterprises with its high-tech facilities and skilled labor.\u201d 2. To \u201cattract product development companies, pilot plants and major corporations.\u201d 3. A focus on \u201ceducation complete with medical schools, research and training institutes.\u201d Figure 8: Satellite imagery overview of Zhangjiang's Pharma Valley. Over 1,000 companies focused on innovative biotechnology and biopharmaceutical products are located in this valley, as stated by Clover Pharmaceuticals, one of the Chinese firms with facilities in Zhangjiang Park. Although this part of the park was designed prior to the release of MIC25, each corner of the base fits into the policy's major technological and pharmaceutical objectives. Figure 9: A time series showing the development of Zhangjiang's Pharma Valley, one of the earlier developments in Zhangjiang Park. Education, Talent Recruitment, and Foreign Investment in Zhangjiang High-Tech Park Three associated MIC25 pillars illustrated by policies and development in Zhangjiang Park are higher education, talent recruitment, and foreign investment. Commercial and Sentinel-1 imagery, as shown below, confirm significant development in areas of the park focused on higher education. Figure 10.1: Land cleared at site of future ShanghaiTech campus, 2010.  Between 2004 and 2010, much of the farmed area was cleared for preparatory construction, as pictured in Figures 10 and 10.1. Early structures and construction equipment were visible in imagery starting in 2014 in Figure 10.2 which confirms consistent, rapid development leading to a fully developed, grass-covered campus visible in 2021 in Figure 10.3. Figure 10.3: Fully-developed ShanghaiTech campus, 2021.  Figure 11: Sentinel-1 and commercial imagery showing development at ShanghaiTech campus.  ShanghaiTech has reported significant personnel growth that aligns with the construction evident in satellite imagery. Faculty numbers at the university grew considerably, with an 87.5% increase in the number of tenured\/tenure-track professors and a 27.2% increase in distinguished professors-in-residence during 2015 alone. Enrollment numbers are reported to have grown accordingly since the launch of MIC25. In 2019, ShanghaiTech admitted 402 undergraduates, a 33% increase from 2015 undergraduate admissions. ShanghaiTech, along with similar universities located in Zhangjiang Park, strives to advance higher education in China and invest in science and technology research. The inclusion of institutions of higher education in the park aligns with MIC25's goal of strengthening the country's education system. Second, STEM research and high-tech fields of study support the industries that MIC25 seeks to vitalize. Its mission statement outlines the University's commitment to \u201ctackling the challenges that China and the world are facing in the fields of energy, materials, environment, human health, biological medical engineering, data science, AI and electrical engineering.\u201d Additionally, in ShanghaiTech's 2015 Annual Report, the university stated that its students \u201care encouraged to align their personal career path with the national strategy.\u201d Figure 13: A series of satellite images showing housing development outside of the border of Zhangjiang along Longdong Avenue. Transportation Infrastructure In order to increase the prominence of China's high-tech industry, construction of transportation infrastructure is necessary to connect new development to international and domestic markets and supply chains. According to a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, the construction of transportation infrastructure in Zhangjiang Park has focused on capitalizing on Zhangjiang Park as a central artery for the movement of goods and people. The first major highway constructed in Zhangjiang Park was Longdong Avenue, which opened to traffic in 1993. Longdong Avenue serves as a connection between the center of the park and Pudong International Airport. Road construction and expansion was substantial within and around the park prior to the initiation of MIC25. Major road construction began in 2004 in order to increase the connections between different industrial zones in the park. VoxEU, a platform focused on research-based policy analysis, reports that the growth of transportation infrastructure increases mobility between areas, \u201cfacilitates technology spillovers between prefectures,\" allowing for \"a greater diffusion of technology along the infrastructure network,\" and lowers the costs of transporting goods. Commercial areas are connected to residential areas through large avenues, which can handle high levels of vehicle traffic and thus make it easier for workers to commute. These avenues are also connected to Central Ring Road, Outer Ring Road, and Luoshan Road, which serve as arteries for transportation throughout greater Shanghai. Figure 14.1: This is a snapshot of Google Earth Engine Sentinel-1 Data showing significant development along the canal bordering Huahongxi Industrial Park. The dashed white line traces the length of the canal. The solid white line outlines the park boundaries. \"Green\" Tech Zhangjiang mirrors MIC25's \u201cgreen\u201d manufacturing focus on promoting energy equipment and energy-saving technologies. More specifically, MIC25 has sought to prioritize green development and environmental consciousness as China continues to industrialize. This objective is apparent in imagery, seen below in Figures 15 and 16. One target sector is electricity, which is an attempt to pay greater attention to rising greenhouse gas emissions related to industrialization and to advance clean energy technologies. Figure 18: The Zhangjiang D2 Charging Station - Electric vehicle charging station. Beyond MIC25 Alignment: Electric Vehicle Manufacturing Zhangjiang Park \u2013 and development within \u2013 aligns with MIC25 mostly through the expansion of pre-existing industrial bases. However, the recent additions in the park of EV manufacturing, electric appliance manufacturing, and EV charging stations demonstrate more direct and timely connections to MIC25 policy and priorities.

{"article":"Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex.json","text":"North Korea's Economy  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex  In partnership with \n CSIS \n and written by \n Joseph Bermudez, \n Marie DuMond, \n and Victor Cha  Latest Wonsan is a dynamic, well-maintained facility Impact rail connection part of 2018 joint declaration Published Jul 9 2018 4\u00a0years, 6\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  Activity around Wonsan is likely to be a leading indication of inter-Korean joint declaration progress given its role both in the eastern transportation corridor and the national economy. Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex is the largest manufacturing and repair facility for railcars in the nation. Analysis of this facility can be a brick-and-mortar signpost of foundational infrastructure progress if rapprochement leads to new opportunities for infrastructure development. Activity Railroads and railway facilities serve as the vital link underpinning North Korea\u2019s underdeveloped economy. Together they present both new possibilities for inter-Korean relations and regional economic cooperation and foundational infrastructure for future unification. However, knowledge of North Korea\u2019s infrastructure is lacking, according to a pilot survey of regional experts conducted by CSIS Beyond Parallel. This study of North Korea\u2019s Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex builds upon our previous report of the Chongjin Railway Factory and together these reports begin to address that void.\nCommercial satellite imagery shows that the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex is currently active and appears to be well maintained by North Korean standards. In addition to its production and repair responsibilities, the complex serves as a center for North Korean railroad technical research and development. Article  Timeline  Graphs  North Korea's railroad system, with over 7,400 kilometers (km) of track, is critical both to the North Korean economy and national defense, serving as the primary means for the country's long-haul cargo and passenger transportation.1 According to the official North Korea 2009 census, Wonsan city is North Korea's fifth-largest city by population size and is the capital of Kangwon province on North Korea's east coast. The city also serves as an important transportation hub with a relatively good highway connection to Pyongyang, an airport, a port, and the Kangwon railway line. Wonsan is best known to the world as a tourist destination. Its importance as such is highlighted by Kim Jong-un's specific mention in his 2018 New Year's address calling for completion \"in the shortest period of time\" of the Wonsan-Kalma tourist area and paying a visit to give on-the-spot guidance in the spring. This has interesting implications for the economic development of industry in the city as large industrial expansion seems unlikely.2 Even so, Wonsan is home to a handful of light and heavy industries with a dozen or so important companies, including the Wonsan Rolling Stock Complex. The city's industries include steel, shipbuilding, cement, shoes, textiles, tractors, fisheries, and others. There are also a number of universities and at least one research institute in Wonsan. Wonsan's port boasts the greatest length of dock space in the country at approximately 3,166 meters. (Though the port's cargo and coal handling capacity is significantly less than the ports in Chongjin and Nampho.) Despite being eclipsed in recent news by the tourist zone development, the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex plays an important role in the city as well as in the regional and national economies. As efforts progress to modernize and reconnect the eastern transportation corridor between North and South Korea under the April 27 Panmunjeom Declaration, a joint declaration for peace, prosperity, and unification, the railcars produced and serviced at the complex could play an increasingly important role. The Wonsan Rolling Stock Complex is one of just five major industrial facilities that undertake railcar production and depot-level repairs for the nationwide network. Recent imagery courtesy of Digital Globe.  Of these national facilities, the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex is the largest manufacturing and repair facility for railroad railcars (also called rolling stock) in the nation. It also undertakes repairs to diesel, electric, and steam locomotives, although it is not known to produce them. As such it represents an indispensable component of both North Korea's economy and national defense.3 Located in the southern section of the port city of Wonsan, Kangwon Province, adjacent to the Kalma Rail Station, the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex (39.140053 127.475910) manufactures and repairs railway rolling stock; repairs steam, diesel, and electric locomotives; and produces railcar and locomotive components and sub-systems. As of June 2018, commercial satellite imagery shows that the complex is active and appears well maintained by North Korean standards. Although North Korean media presents a picture of the facility working at full potential, the production capacity and actual output levels for the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex are unknown. Some dated reports indicate a possible annual production capacity of up to 200 passenger and 2,000 freight cars.4 Commercial satellite imagery and domestic reporting with ground imagery indicate that the complex produces or repairs a wide range of railcars, including 40-ton flat cars, 60-, 100-, and potentially 125-ton ore cars, box\/refrigerator, two-bay hopper (covered and uncovered), log\/lumber, gondolas, passenger cars, and tank. Although none were seen in either satellite and ground imagery, the complex likely produces and repairs specialized maintenance-of-way (MoW) and industrial cars. Additionally, it repairs locomotives (diesel, electric, and steam). The complex may also engage in small-scale scrapping of railcars and locomotives, and the recovery of reusable components.5 Manufacturing operations for ore cars inside an assembly hall at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex. Two sets of two-axle railcar trucks are visible in the foreground. (Uriminjokkkiri, May 1, 2013)  In addition to its production and repair responsibilities, the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex serves as a center for railroad technical research and development. Scientists and technicians from the complex work with researchers from the Railway Science Branch of the State Academy of Sciences and publish their work in North Korean scientific and technical journals.6 Attesting to the complex's importance to the nation over the years, Kim Il-song, Kim Jong-il, and senior officials have visited the factory on a number of occasions and it has been frequently mentioned in North Korean media.7 There are, however, no readily available reports of Kim Jong-un visiting the factory since he came to power. Among the senior leaders to have visited the complex in recent years was Choe Ryong Hae, vice-chairman of the State Affairs Commission, and vice-chairman of the Worker's Party of Koreas Central Committee.8 The complex encompasses an irregular-shaped, fenced-in area of approximately 540,000 m2 (133 acres) and can be broken down into three functional areas: administration, engineering, and support; manufacturing and repair; and rail yard.

The manufacturing and repair facilities occupy the center of the complexmost notably 10 large assembly, repair, and fabrication halls. These halls are connected by two rail transfer tablesthe largest being approximately 420-meters-longthat move heavy parts, subassemblies, and railcars from building to building or between bays in the same building. Recent imagery courtesy of Digital Globe.  The engineering and support facilities (fabrication shops, forges\/foundries, sheds, greenhouse, miscellaneous structures) are located along the northwest side and south-central section of the facility. These support facilities reportedly use some computer numerically controlled (CNC) equipment and appear to manufacture almost all the components (e.g., road wheels, trucks, springs, couplers) from both semi-finished components and raw materials required for production and repair operations.9 On the north side of this section is a basin used for storing logs before they are brought into the adjacent woodworking shop. There are also several greenhouses located around the complex and what appears to be a water treatment plant in the southeast corner. Recent imagery courtesy of Digital Globe.  The rail yard is stub-ended and is served by a compound ladder with approximately 20 tracks of various lengths and functions (e.g., shipping, receiving, holding, classification). In the center of the rail yard is an open-air storage yard. Immediately north of the complex is a separate facility that appears to be for locomotive servicing (e.g., fueling, sanding, washing, minor maintenance). It is unclear if this is formally part of the complex. Recent imagery courtesy of Digital Globe.  Commercial satellite imagery from 2014 through 2018 shows that the total number of railcars observed at the complex has varied from a high of 88 on December 22, 2014, to a low of 59 on June 6, 2018 (these numbers include the adjacent engine servicing facility).10 This should not necessarily be taken as an indication of slowing output at the complex as each image examined for this report shows both significant differences in the numbers and types of railcars present and their positioning within the facility. Instead, this suggests a dynamic production and repair facility responding to shifting demands for rolling stock and the availability of semi-finished products and raw material. For example, among the railcars present in a December 2014 image were approximately 29 ore cars\/gondolas, 12 boxcars, and 28 passenger cars. In a June 2018 image there were approximately 17 ore cars\/gondolas, 22 boxcars, and 9 passenger cars. As railcar production and repair are heavily dependent upon steel, and to a lesser degree upon iron and aluminum, fluctuations in the supply of these materials undoubtedly affect the output at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex. None of the North Korean media ground imagery reviewed for this report shows either modern manufacturing equipment or techniques employed at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex. Therefore, the production output is likely significantly lower in quantity and quality to similar-sized facilities in Asia or the West. Additionally, this ground imagery shows a facility that is in need of significant infrastructure maintenance and numerous unaddressed safety issues. Should foreign financial investment be directed to the complex in the future, a substantial amount will likely be absorbed in addressing these issues before any meaningful profit be realized.

(Rodong Sinmun, May 10, 2015)  Obvious in summer or fall imagery of the complex is that a significant portion of all open spaces is being used for gardening. Such gardening is typical of large industrial facilities in North Korea; however, unlike the Chongjin Railway Factory, the tracks at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex are generally well maintained, ballasted, and relatively clear of gardening activity, indicating active use.

Some projects have experienced construction delays, with two of the largest activities also subjected to rampant corruption. Negotiations have occurred primarily at the national level, resulting in a more cohesive energy development strategy overall. However, corruption by the former Correa administration impacted project progress and quality.  Activity This Tearline article from the College of William & Mary\u2019s geoLab discusses findings from a project which utilizes open-source data collection and imagery analysis to study the impacts of Chinese development financing in Latin America and the Caribbean. The article examines evidence of eight hydroelectric power projects and\/or dams in Ecuador in order to gain an understanding of Chinese actions and hypothesize Chinese intentions in the region. Satellite imagery shows that five of the projects have been completed. However, for the other three projects, our analysis indicates that construction has been paused for a significant amount of time. These indefinite delays are partially due to corruption in the Ecuadorian government and the projects themselves. Our assessment of the conditions of these BRI projects is based primarily on government data, then verified by imagery analysis and other open-source material due to the Ecuadorian national government\u2019s direct involvement in four of the projects. Article  Timeline  Graphs  In 2013, Xi Jinping launched China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a series of infrastructure investments and diplomatic endeavors that would be the guiding force for China's foreign policy. According to the Chinese government, the BRI seeks to promote political trust, economic integration, and cultural inclusiveness throughout the global community. The BRI assumes that the integrated economic development financed by China will create, or reinforce, a peaceful, cooperative international community and increase the economic prosperity and living standards of local communities participating in BRI activities. If this assumption holds true, the BRI has the potential to have a significant impact due to its unprecedented size: the BRI is composed of at least 3,485 projects across 138 countries, with over 273.6 billion USD in official Chinese financing. However, the BRI has been heavily criticized for its imposition of Chinese ideals, quality of implementation of the projects, and the relative success of the projects. The BRI is primarily concentrated in the Afro-Eurasia geographic regions, most notably along six highlighted economic corridors. As the BRI has grown, projects are no longer solely located in these corridors--a trend most visible in the BRI's expansion to Latin America & the Caribbean. As of 2021, 19 countries in this region have signed a formal Memorandum of Understandings (MoU) with China to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative. Original work by W&M geoLab  Globally, many BRI projects have occurred in the energy sector, seeking to improve energy security and meet the energy needs for potential industrial expansion. If these energy projects are from renewable sources--which the Chinese government announced as a goal of the BRI in May 2017--then the BRI has the ability to transform energy sectors to favor low-carbon emitting sources in recipient countries and aid these countries in meeting the United Nations Paris Climate Agreement's outlined sustainability goals. However, a significant portion of BRI energy projects is still fossil fuel-based. In Latin America, even the non-fossil fuel energy projects--such as hydropower, which accounts for 71% of the world's supply of renewable energy--financed by China carry their own significant environmental consequences. Leaving the question of whether the title of low-carbon emitting energy source automatically indicates a certain level of environmental sustainability. In Ecuador, the shift in energy resources to prioritize hydroelectric power began when the Ecuadorian Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Energy (MEER) was created in 2007, re-opening the once privatized Ecuadorian energy sector. This prioritization was reiterated in MEER's 2012 to 2021 electrification plan. These actions were complemented by Ecuador's new constitution in 2008, known as the 'Buen Vivir' [the 'Good Life'] constitution; it echoes the indigenous philosophy of a \"community-centric, ecologically-balanced and culturally-sensitive\" existence. The constitution prioritizes indigenous rights, environmental sustainability, and state sovereignty. The development plan based on the constitution outlined the goal of \"energy sovereignty\" primarily through the development of hydroelectric power in order to reduce dependency on \"both Western creditors and on a petro economy.\" Former President Rafael Correa's objective was to scale down Ecuador's dependence on thermoelectric power and fossil fuels and produce enough energy to meet domestic energy needs as well as export electricity to neighboring countries. Further, between 2021 and 2022, Ecuador is planning to export 8% of the energy generated by hydroelectric power projects (HPP). In 2015, Vice President Jorge Glas stated that once all projects are constructed and running, hydroelectric energy would account for 93% of the nation's energy production. To achieve this objective, Correa sought out greater hydroelectric power opportunities with China's help, resulting in the construction of eight major dams. While BRI investments in Ecuador largely began with the inauguration of the BRI in 2013, Ecuador's then-President Lenin Moreno formally signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China's Xi Jinping on December 13, 2018. This formal agreement has strengthened Ecuador and China's relationships and increased the presence of the BRI in Ecuador. Beyond hydropower, BRI projects in Ecuador have primarily aimed to restore general infrastructure and mining operations destroyed by the April 2016 7.8 magnitude earthquake in northern Ecuador. Original work by W&M geoLab  There are currently eight Chinese-associated HPPs in Ecuador. This paper will analyze these eight projects in terms of interactions with the environment, local community impact, and legal issues (all scores on these ndicators are visible in the accompanying scorecard). We will additionally compare how the BRI operates and its relative success in the hydropower sector in comparison to Bolivia. Summary of project outcomes: Construction is complete at four of the eight projects (Sopladora, Minas San Francisco, Delsitanisagua, and Canar & Naranjal). During construction, there were minimal environmental impacts, positive community development initiatives, and limited corruption. Construction at two of the eight (Mazar-Dudas and Quijos) projects has been delayed since December 2015 due to contract terminations. During the delays, there have been substantial positive community development initiatives but some negative environmental impacts. Construction is complete at one of the eight (Coca Codo Sinclair) projects but was hindered by corruption along with both negative environmental and local community impacts. Construction at one of the eight (Toachi Pilaton) projects has been delayed due to corruption. There were negative impacts on both environment and local communities. Lessons to take away from these BRI projects: Ecuadorian government oversight successfully mitigated some of the negative environmental and community impacts of hydroelectric power projects and dams. Additionally, this oversight led to two contract terminations for non-compliance. Pervasive Ecuadorian federal-level corruption impacted many project facets. Ecuador's continued debt to China, initiated by Correa's 2008 default and rejection of Western finance, has created a dependency on China. If Ecuador wishes to rejuvenate its diplomatic and economic relationship with the United States, as indicated in the actions during the first half of 2021, a new policy direction must be taken. Methodology In this article, and the previously released case study on hydropower in Bolivia, each BRI project was analyzed in the context of the environment, community impact, and legal indicators. These three indicators were then broken down into relevant success factors. For each success factor, each project was ranked as unsuccessful (0), neutral (1), or successful (2). To rate the overall impact of the dams, the scores for each project were averaged out, creating a scaled ranking of unsuccessful (0 - 0.68), neutral (0.69 - 1.34), and successful (1.35 - 2). For more information on the specific rankings for each project and success factors, see the corecard of hydro project factors and our RI threshold matrix to see what factors we used to classify projects as BRI or not. For more information on other aspects of the projects themselves, including financing and construction status, see the tables in the Graphs section. Structured Data In addition to this case study narrative on hydro projects in Ecuador, we created 60+ points of locational and structured data of official BRI projects and related non-BRI activities in Latin America and the Caribbean. The downloadable spreadsheet marks BRI projects as official, informal, or funded by private Chinese money. The KMZ and Shapefiles only contain project locations that were mappable at a high level of precision. Some projects are attributed at the national level and coordinates were not used in these cases. However, all projects are listed within the spreadsheet available. The Ecuadorian Context Inaugurated in 2007, left-wing, anti-imperialist populist turned President Rafael Correa announced his goal of \"[freeing] Ecuador from the orbit of the United States.\" Correa quickly separated Ecuador diplomatically from the United States by refusing to renew an agreement for a US military base in Manta and declaring the US Ambassador to Ecuador as a persona non grata. Financial ties were severed in late 2008 when Correa canceled 3.2 billion USD in debt to the IMF because the debt was \"immoral and illegitimate,\" according to Correa himself. With oil prices low, the world in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, and Ecuador still deep in debt, Ecuador turned to the only lender willing to interact in a high-risk environment, China. While Correa had no access to foreign capital, a serious issue since Ecuador utilizes the US dollar as its official currency, he did have oil. Ecuador has the third-largest oil reserves in South America, after Venezuela and Brazil, and was estimated in 2013 to have produced approximately 550,000 barrels per day for an export amount of 11.9 billion USD. In 2008, to gain access to this seemingly unlimited line of Chinese credit from state-owned banks, Ecuador granted almost 90% of its oil exportation for the foreseeable future to China. This action, and Ecuador's quickly booming relationship with China, stands in direct contrast to the ideals outlined by the 2008 'Buen Vivir' [the 'Good Life'] constitution. From 2005 to 2013, prior to the inauguration of the BRI, China accounted for 57% of all foreign investment in Ecuador. Under Correa, who was in power from 2017 to 2021, Ecuador borrowed over 19 billion USD from Chinese banks for BRI projects, each of these loans is opaque and contains high-interest rates. In 2016, China became Ecuador's largest bilateral debt holder. China and Ecuador economically benefited from each other, with China supplying billions in much-needed credit to Ecuador in return for oil and a profitable outlet for Chinese companies. Instead of using this oil as a resource in China, as Ecuador assumed was the plan, China sold it to regional markets in the Western Hemisphere at a profit. Inaugurated in May 2017, Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno chose to slightly de-emphasize Ecuador's dependence on China. Other nations, including Turkey, are attempting to \"balance China out by increasing foreign relations with other nations,\" in hope of reducing dependency on China. Moreno's energy minister Carlos Perez publicly stated that \"China took advantage of Ecuador. The strategy of China is clear. They take economic control of countries.\" However, throughout Moreno's term in office, he continued to borrow money from China, notably visiting China in December 2018 to both renegotiate Ecuador's debt and borrow another 900 million USD. Correa, in a fiery Twitter response to a New York Times article about Ecuador's debt to China, called the newspaper a \"charade\" with \"ludicrous\" claims, arguing that \"Ecuador is a good Latin American example of how to establish sovereign and mutually beneficial relations with China.\" Under Moreno, Ecuador's attempt at reforming a diplomatic relationship with the US was positively received, as the US began developing a policy to actively counteract Chinese intentions and actions in Latin America. In December 2019, the US State Department pioneered the \"America Crece\" plan which seeks to \"leverage existing programs [and] diplomatic engagement\" in order to grow US influence. In January 2020, a week before Biden was inaugurated as the US President, the US Development Finance Corporation signed an agreement with Ecuador's then-President Moreno for 2.8 billion USD to, according to US officials, \"refinance predatory Chinese debt\" and support private sector investment. The agreement also prohibited Ecuador from purchasing Chinese tech products. This all paired with the perception that China's explosive growth is faltering and may lead to a decrease in BRI project financing. However, the strength of the Chinese economy and its ability to lend is somewhat hindered due to the lack of transparency. Regardless of the financier, Ecuador is \"trapped once again in the vicious cycle of debt: contracting new debt to pay the old.\" Experts analyze that this agreement sought to directly influence the first round of Ecuador's presidential election in February 2021 and influence the country to not vote for the current leading contender Andres Arauz, a supporter of Correa who promised: \"to reverse Moreno's fealty to the United States and his subordination to the IMF's deflationary policies.\" At any rate, Arauz did not win the election. Inaugurated on May 24th, 2021, Guillermo Lasso, Ecuador's first center-right president in two decades, is a market-friendly banker, a stark contrast to Ecuador's recent history with populists. Unlike his presidential predecessors, Lasso is shifting away from Chinese support and backing, focusing more on (re)building Ecuador's relationship with the U.S. while still maintaining good rapport with China. However, Ecuador cannot fully let go of China. In terms of hydroelectric power, the appointment of Juan Carlos Bermeo as Lasso's Minister of Energy, a former executive of Petroamazonas, indicates that Ecuadorian policy in the hydroelectric sphere will remain the same. Environment While hydroelectric power projects are a non-fossil fuel emitting renewable energy source that can significantly reduce a region's carbon emissions, these projects can have negative impacts on the environment. Recent academic research, primarily focused on the Amazon and Mekong River basins, has found a pattern across the several studied projects of \"disrupting river ecology, deforestation, losing aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity, [and] releasing substantial greenhouse gases.\" More specifically, HPPs in the Andean headwaters of the Amazon, which several of the BRI projects in Ecuador are located, threaten the habitats of 671 freshwater fish species and the level of sediment downstream in the Amazon basin. The decrease of sediment contribution \"[translates] to drastic alteration of river channel and floodplain geomorphology and associated ecosystem services.\" In Ecuador, droughts have been a continuous problem due to El Nino and La Nina phases, impacting HPPs' capacity to generate electricity and challenging the government to find ways to supplement this loss and lack of electricity. Even with this knowledge of environmental conditions and implications, the Correa and Moreno administrations both continued to support the Chinese constructed hydroelectric power projects. The environmental impacts of these projects in Ecuador are similar to those in Bolivia, however, per our rating system detailed on the corecard, HPPs ranked higher in Ecuador than in Bolivia. This section will discuss the project-specific interactions with the environmental indicators listed on our scorecard: air, land, water, and biodiversity. These three dams--Coca Codo Sinclair, Mazar-Dudas, and Quijos--were chosen due to the relative wealth of open-source information surrounding them. For more information on the environmental interactions of all eight of the projects, ee the scorecard. Coca Codo Sinclair The Coca Codo Sinclair dam is the largest hydroelectric power project in Ecuador and is the largest project funded by the China Export-Import Bank (CHEXIM) in Ecuador. The HPP was proposed by the Ecuadorian government in 1976, but due to financial constraints and the eruption of the nearby Reventador volcano in 1987, construction on the HPP did not begin until 2010. Of the 2.6 billion USD construction cost, CHEXIM loaned the Ecuadorian government 1.68 billion USD that is payable within 15 years. The remaining funds were provided by the Ecuadorian government. The hydroelectric power complex has the potential to generate 1,500 megawatts (MW), which would supply nearly 35% of the country's electricity. This would lead to a yearly reduction of 4.43 million tons of carbon dioxide. Even though the project has been operational and producing power for the electrical grid since its opening in November 2016, the HPP has failed to produce the expected amount of energy. Several days after its official opening, a full capacity test was attempted. The equipment did not perform well and \"shuttered\" causing rolling blackouts across the country. The test did aim for full capacity but the local power grid could not handle the full output. There are no published plans for the HPP to operate at its full capacity of 1,500 MW, however, a July 2019 statement by CELEC announced that \"Ecuador will definitively not take over the plant until all the works permitting Coca Codo Sinclair to operate normally have been carried out.\" The efficiency of the HPP has been partially compromised due to its proximity to the active Reventador volcano, as visible in the inset in the February 2020 satellite image, causing 7,648 cracks in the infrastructure as early as 2014, two years prior to the completion of the construction. There is no information indicating that attempts were made to remedy these and prevent further cracks. Instead, the senior Ecuadorian engineer who recorded these cracks and sent them to Correa was fired a few days later. inset source, https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/12\/24\/world\/americas\/ecuador-china-dam.html  Since the dam's construction began in 2010, the negative impacts on biodiversity and river flow are fairly evident. Erosion on the banks of the river and the surrounding area is at the heart of the environmental degradation caused by the construction of the HPP. Geologists hypothesize that the Coca Codo Sinclair HPP caused an imbalance to the Coca River, inciting fast-moving erosion upstream and consequently, the disappearance of the San Rafael waterfall. In April 2020, an oil spill, some have attributed to landslides caused by the loss of the San Rafael waterfall, of over 15,000 gallons not only polluted the waters and destroyed wildlife, but has since impacted over 150,000 people, many of whom are Kichwa indigenous people. Everything from peoples' food sources, livelihoods, health, and farming lands has been contaminated by the spill. Furthermore, the landslides have raised concerns in the nearby town of Cuyuja to fear that the dam's transmission towers may topple over. Geologists suspect that the tower foundations were not built into the bedrock by the Chinese. At any rate, a 2008 independent study by an environmental group raised many of these concerns and implications. The Coca Codo Sinclair dam has diverted some of the Coca River flow, as visible in the February 2020 satellite image. This, in tandem with sediment discharge and the disappearance of the San Rafael waterfall, also visible in the February 2020 satellite image, could have significant negative impacts on species loss. That being said, the national government has implemented a program to \"restore and revegetate\" biodiverse areas that were impacted by the infrastructure. It is unclear what the scope of this project is and whether it can successfully balance out the negative impacts of the dam. Mazar-Dudas Funded by a 41.6 million USD loan from the China Development Bank (CDB) in 2012, the run-of-the-river Mazar-Dudas hydroelectric complex is located along the Pindilig and Mazar Rivers, as visible in the February 2020 satellite image. The complex, composed of the 6.23 MW Alazan HPP, 7.19 San Antonio HPP, and 7.40 Dudas HPP, will generate a total of 21 MW. The hydroelectric complex will reduce carbon emissions by 60,768 tons annually. Due to contractual issues, the project has been halted since December 2015, with only the Alazan HPP--connected to Ecuador's energy grid in April 2015--as operational. Set to be built in a protected area, the HPPs could pose a threat to the Dudas-Mazar forest, highlighted in the February 2020 satellite image, which is home to hundreds of species of flora, fauna, and trees. However, in contrast to Coca Codo Sinclair, these three HPPs are run-of-the-river, meaning the projects include smaller dams, and thus, have a smaller impact on the course of the river and threat on the ecology of the Dudas-Mazar forest--an undeniable positive for minimizing the environmental impact. This is important to note as the way an HPP is constructed directly impacts the project's interactions with the environment. However, the construction of a run-of-the-river HPP is dependent on the geography of the river and the amount of energy desired. This type of HPP was not possible, for instance, for the Coca Codo Sinclair project. Additionally, the preliminary construction of Mazar-Dudas led to some geological issues as rock drilling occurred. The environmental impact assessment, carried out prior to the project's construction, did not initially anticipate these geological issues, which have directly impacted the cost and timeline of the project's implementation. Quijos Similar to the Mazar-Dudas hydroelectric power complex, the Quijos hydroelectric power project was funded by the China Development Bank (CDB), constructed by China National Electric Engineering Company (CNEEC), and overseen by Corporacion Electrica del Ecuador (CELEC), all of which are state-owned enterprises in their respective countries. Construction began in 2012 and was expected to be completed in March 2016. Due to contractual issues, the project has been halted since December 2015 and remains uncompleted, as visible in the December 2020 satellite image. The project is estimated to cost 115 million USD. CDB is financing 94.7 million USD. The project will have the capacity to generate 50 MW of electricity. Quijos HPP will have both positive and negative impacts on the environment. The project, upon completion, will reduce yearly carbon emissions by 180,000 tons, a positive. However, the project requires tunnels to be built, including the already visible diversion tunnel seen in the imagery, passing through a \"geologically unstable\" mountain to guide the flow of two rivers' water into penstocks downstream, a negative. Building tunnels through unstable mountains can lead to collapse, landslides, avalanches, and greater geohazards. The Quijos HPP, like the Coca Codo Sinclair complex, is also thought to threaten the San Rafael waterfall. This would have an impact on the native plant species that depend on natural river fluctuations. Local Community Impact Hydroelectric power projects can have the potential to significantly impact the communities living around the project because many depend on the rivers' resources for their food and livelihoods. More specifically, the environmental changes caused by an HPP can lead to the displacement of thousands of people and alter livelihoods through the project's impact on food systems, water quality, and agriculture. To mitigate this threat to communities' food and economic security, many of the BRI hydroelectric power projects and\/or dams in Ecuador are accompanied by several social and economic development programs and initiatives. These programs appear to improve local communities' livelihood through the creation of jobs, improvement of infrastructure and increasing access to electricity. These initiatives stand in stark contrast to the BRI projects in Bolivia, where no community development programs accompanied the HPPs. Our analysis indicates that this vast difference is due to the different approaches of the recipient country's federal governments. Ecuador mandated that projects include these initiatives, and often financed and implemented the initiatives themselves, even though Chinese SOEs were the primary implementers for the infrastructure projects. This section will discuss the project-specific interactions with these community impact indicators: labor, local communities, social development, economic growth, energy, and infrastructure. These four projects--Sopladora, Delsitanisagua, Canar and Naranjal, and Minas San Francisco--were chosen due to the relative wealth of open information surrounding them, especially media coverage focused on highlighting community impacts. For more information on the community interactions of all eight of the projects, see the corecard. Sopladora The Sopladora hydroelectric power project is the third-largest hydroelectric power project in Ecuador, with an expected capacity of 487 MW. The project does not include a dam as it instead relies on water discharged from the nearby Paute River. In 2011, the CHEXIM granted a loan of 571 million USD for the construction of the project, covering 85% of the total cost, while the other 15% was financed by Ecuadorian sources. China Gezhouba Group, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, and the private Ecuadorian company Fopeca constructed the project. The Ecuador state-owned operator, Corporacion Electrica del Ecuador (CELEC), carried out studies of the physical, environmental, social, and archeological impacts of the project within a 1,318-hectare area surrounding the project. Because the project is completely underground, negative impacts, in terms of both the environment and community development, were minimal because there are fewer dependencies when compared to above-ground projects. In August 2016, the plant was inaugurated and started generating electricity. There was a significant amount of Ecuadorian labor involved within the project even amid the nominal contractual requirements that the Sopladora HPP must be built by Chinese companies using Chinese equipment and labor. Locally, 746 jobs were created along with 2,000 additional jobs generated for Ecuadorians from other parts of the country, a positive for the Ecuadorian economy. Most of the project's managers and high-skilled laborers were directly from China, while the low-skilled labor was occupied by Ecuadorians. There were more Ecuadorian laborers than Chinese laborers, with eight out of ten workers at Sopladora as Ecuadorian. In general, the project management and higher construction salaries went to the Chinese laborers. Additionally, this model does not facilitate knowledge transfer to Ecuadorian workers, creating a further dependency on Chinese companies, a negative, especially in regards to Ecuador's desire of sovereignty in development, as outlined in the 'Buen Vivir' constitution. The construction site had few safety precautions in place, leading to the death of seven workers during the project's construction: a failed attempt to expand a well with explosives killed four Chinese workers in addition to three lives lost due to undisclosed activities. The Sopladora HPP included positive improvements to local infrastructure, which are expected to benefit 800,000 people in the surrounding areas. The improvements include educational infrastructure projects, upgrades to health facilities, the construction of new roads, and the construction and improvement of drinking and sanitation systems. These projects were executed by CELEC, not the Chinese SOEs involved with the project, despite the fact that the Chinese SOEs are the primary funder and implementer for the project. However, on the negative side, local family farms on the site and residents of the town of San Jose de Guarumales were displaced by the project's construction. As seen in the September 2020 imagery, the diversion tunnel passes right through the town. To balance this loss of home and livelihoods, as these communities were dependent on the river for food and economic security, CELEC promised to execute training in tourism and strengthen the capacity of agricultural and livestock. Delsitanisagua In 2011, CDB financed the construction of the Delsitanisagua HPP and dam, which has a generating capacity of 180 MW with three turbines. CDB granted 185 million USD for the project, however, the actual cost of the project increased by 55% during construction. This increase violates Ecuadorian law, which restricts project costs to stay within 35% of the amount dictated by the original contract. It is unclear how the Ecuadorian government chose to finance the rest of the project and whether CDB chose to grant or loan more capital, but it is clear that the Delsitanisagua hydroelectric power project placed a large financial burden on Ecuador. One source said that Ecuador may have repaid money loaned from CDB with oil sales for Delsitanisagua, which Ecuador has done for other BRI projects due to Ecuador's loss of access to international capital markets following its 2008 default. China's state-owned HydroChina, a hydropower and engineering company, led the construction of the project. Because of the unanticipated cost increase of the project, halfway through implementation, Hydrochina's contract increased from 195 million USD to 258 million USD. Two years after the project's expected completion date, the HPP was inaugurated in December 2018, and generated more than 829 gigawatts\/hour of energy to Ecuador's National Interconnected System (SIN) in its first year of operation. However, this energy production has not been consistent, as the project has halted operation multiple times, including in May 2020 to clean the reservoir due to sediment accumulation interfering with the turbines. Imagery from late May 2020 shows that the dam did resume operation after being cleaned. While the official number of project workers is unknown, 1,531 jobs were designated for local laborers. This project will directly positively benefit 91,376 inhabitants of the Zamora-Chinchipe province. The construction of the project, like many in Ecuador, is accompanied by community and social development initiatives, beyond the expansion of rural electric power networks that will benefit 1,606 inhabitants in the local communities. Associated initiatives and infrastructure improvements include 3 potable water systems, 129 basic sanitary units for 408 inhabitants, a wastewater treatment plant for 200 inhabitants, the construction of a communal house for 195 inhabitants, and multiple economic training programs to strengthen the economic capacity of these communities. inset source, https:\/\/www.geodata.it\/en\/sectors\/portfolio-hydro\/item\/delsitanisagua-hydroelectric-power-plant.html  Canar and Naranjal The Canar and Naranjal flood control projects were financed by the state-owned Bank of China and privately owned Chinese Branch of Deutsche Bank, and implemented by the state-owned China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE) and Ecuadorian state-owned company Senagua. Signed in July 2013, the 298.9 million USD loan came attached with a high-interest rate of over 3.5%. Construction on the project was completed in January 2016 and included a 23 km canal, a diversion dam, two newly constructed bridges, and upgrades to existing roads and other bridges. The infrastructure improvement of replacing old bridges is visible in the satellite imagery. While the project itself does not produce hydroelectric power, the project diverts river water into eight Chinese turbines that are estimated to produce enough electricity to power one-third of Ecuador through the national grid system. We chose to include this project in our hydroelectric power analysis because the primary purpose of the Canar and Naranjal flood control project was to improve the efficiency and efficacy of the nearby eight turbines. This project is in itself a positive community development initiative, as it improved local infrastructure and protect communities from flooding. This flood defense project will protect 150,000 people and will save millions from the effects of extreme weather and climate change. Former President Correa said that these projects will \"avoid the loss of 105 million USD in crops.\" The project will protect more than 40,000 hectares of fertile land. Minas San Francisco Minas San Francisco was financed by CHEXIM in 2012 and constructed by the private Chinese company, Harbin Electric International. CHEXIM loaned 312.4 million USD as a line of credit with an interest rate of over 4%. However, the price tag of the project increased by 34% (barely below the legal limit of 35%) during construction to a final cost of 684 million USD. It is unclear how the project was funded beyond the CHEXIM loan. The plant's installed capacity is 270 MW, with three turbines that each have the capacity to generate 90 MW, and it has been operating at full capacity since construction completed in January 2019, three years behind schedule. In June 2020 the management of the project was handed over to Ecuador's CELEC. The project provided 2,798 local jobs and an additional 13,500 jobs generated indirectly. a positive. The project's community development initiatives include increased accessibility to electricity, maintenance of basic services and sanitation systems, and training in improving agricultural productivity and techniques. These initiatives will positively benefit over 136,000 inhabitants of the local communities surrounding San Sebastian. Minas San Francisco and some of the other discussed hydroelectric power projects and\/or dams have balanced out the traditionally negative community impacts through an active effort to benefit local communities. These benefits can have positive impacts by improving economic security through job creation and training programs. In addition, local conditions are improved with new infrastructure. Legal Issues In our case study of Bolivia, we discussed how grassroots mobilization efforts successfully delayed projects. In Ecuador, there have been no mass mobilizations against hydroelectric power projects and\/or dams. This is significant because like Bolivia, Ecuador has a recent history of large protests, most notably the October 2019 indigenous-led protests against changes in fuel prices that resulted in violence. One potential reason for this difference is the hydroelectric power projects and\/or dams in Ecuador were almost always accompanied by social development programs and more respectful of indigenous homes and livelihoods. Instead, impediments to the progress and operation of projects have all occurred in a more formal arena in Ecuador with the federal government more actively involved. This section will discuss the project-specific interactions with legal issues such as corruption and contractual agreements. The indicator of corruption was measured based on various legal findings of corruption related to these projects. It is possible that more projects were impacted by both federal and local levels of corruption, however, this possibility has not been proved in court, and thus, will not be discussed. These four dams--Coca Codo Sinclair, Toachi Pilaton, Mazar-Dudas, and Quijos--were chosen due to the relative wealth of open-source information surrounding them. Coca Codo Sinclair The Coca Codo Sinclair HPP generates a significant surplus of energy exported to neighboring countries such as Colombia and Peru. However, this dam has been plagued with problems, including 7,648 cracks and the facility was built near an active volcano. Coca Codo Sinclair EP (COCASINCLAIR EP), an Ecuadorian \"state-owned special-purpose enterprise established in 2010,\" signed an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract with the Chinese state-owned Sinohydro. This EPC or \"turnkey\" contract stated that Sinohydro would have 66 months to construct and finish the project and would be responsible for subcontracting and importing required materials, equipment, services, and technology. Another report from Consulting Inspection Services, an American company, claims that the numerous structural problems were caused by the use of construction materials by Sinohydro that did not meet industry standards, which is in breach of the EPC contract. Many serious challenges were faced during construction, including the death of 16 workers, multiple orders of suspension, and even a warning of termination of the contract due to engineering failures and non-compliance issues. After worker strikes at the construction site in 2011 and 2012, inspections by the National Assembly and a report by the State Comptroller both found violations of workers' rights. Furthermore, during the project, 14 civil lawsuits were filed against Sinohydro, and 92 labor claims, 80 of them being against Sinohydro and 12 against COCASINCLAIR EP. Sinohydro also failed to provide adequate training programs for the personnel operating the plant. These training programs were part of the contract Sinohydro signed. The project was completed and the contract was fulfilled, however, our evidence suggests that Sinohydro did not fulfill the duties expected of them. The only known legal action taken against China, is Ecuador's Ministry of Labor and the Social Security Institute fined Sinohydro the small amount of 5,280 USD. This measure, similar to other Ecuadorian state action taken in legal disputes at these BRI projects, was all reactive instead of proactive. Almost every top Ecuadorian official involved in the project's construction has been either imprisoned or sentenced on bribery charges. Former Ecuadorian Vice President Jorge Glas Espinel was convicted of taking bribes from China's main competitor in the region, the Brazilian construction company, Odebrecht. An article from the New York Times says that Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht \"paid 33.5 million USD in bribes in Ecuador as part of a worldwide scheme to win business.\" The former electricity minister, Alecksey Mosquera is now serving a 5-year sentence for taking 1 million USD from Odebrecht. Toachi Pilaton In February 2008, the first cornerstone was laid for the construction of the Toachi Pilaton hydroelectric power project. Later that year in September 2008, then-President Correa expelled their contractor, Odebrecht after international exposure of bribery and corruption. The termination of this contract saw a loss of 13 million USD. In 2010, Ecuador's CELEC signed an agreement to finance the project with Russia's Export-Import Bank (Roseximbank). The building was contracted to China's CWE for civil construction (contract amount was 240 million USD) and Russia's Inter RAO UES for electromechanical equipment. In response to construction delays, in February 2015 Ecuador's President Correa fined CWE 3.25 million USD. In December 2016, Correa once again called for the termination of the contract and in doing so, lost 3.6 million USD of public funds. Furthermore, the arrest of Alecksey Mosquera in April 2016, former minister of electricity under Rafael Correa's administration, was made after he allegedly accepted advance payment bribes amounting to nearly 1 million USD from Odebrecht for the construction of the dam. Correa has claimed it was just a business agreement. In June 2016, a report by the State Comptroller's Office concluded that CWE violated and breached their contract, regarding the construction of the extensive tunnel system for the project. CWE did not carry out and comply with the \"designs, plans, and technical specifications.\" The report also discussed the fact that the contractor, CWE, did not have \"a soil and concrete laboratory, which allows for quality control of the concrete incorporated into the project.\" Local electricity officials requested the removal of the CWE superintendent of the project due to violations of basic labor rights found in CWE's mistreatment of workers. While both Chinese and Russian SOEs were involved with this stage of Toachi Pilaton, it is CWE's failings that resulted in the contract termination. In 2019, a new contract was signed with a Russian Company, Tyazhmash, to complete the Toachi Pilaton Project. Despite more recent delays caused by the Ecuadorian government's COVID-19 regulations, which prohibited foreign personnel from entering the country and inhibited local companies from fully operating, 86.90% of the project was completed as of July 2020. While expected to be completed in the latter half of 2021, satellite imagery shows evidence of recent plant growth on the project, indicating construction delays and a lack of progress on parts of the site. However, imagery from 2019 and 2020 shows ongoing construction for the Pilaton intake dam and the Allurquin substation. The Toachi Pilaton project is anticipated to produce 254 MW of electricity between the 2 HPPs, Sarapullo (50.4 MW) and Alluriquin (204 MW). Construction created 2,075 jobs and will benefit 471,000 inhabitants. Like many Chinese-backed projects in Ecuador, the Toachi Pilaton project is accompanied by numerous social development projects such as improving potable water systems, expanding electricity networks, improving local infrastructure, and boosting local health facilities. The construction of the HPP is said to not have displaced any indigenous or vulnerable groups. inset source, https:\/\/lahora.com.ec\/noticia\/1102226026\/la-conclusion-de-toachi-pilaton-costara-140-millones-de-dolares  Mazar-Dudas and Quijos As discussed previously, both Mazar-Dudas and Quijos were funded by CDB and constructed by CNEEC. For both projects, CELEC terminated the CNEEC contract in December 2015 due to non-compliance. Construction has not occurred at either of the HPP project sites since 2015, supported by both satellite imagery and Ecuadorian government data from May 2020 and March 2021 respectively. Government data claims Mazar-Dudas is 87.33% complete and Quijos 46.72% complete. Media coverage shows that Quijos specifically has virtually been abandoned. In May 2020, the Ecuadorian government announced that the Mazar-Dudas project would be completed by 2021, but there is no evidence observed on satellite images of construction restarting. For instance, no trucks or other equipment necessary to finish constructing the project have been observed. For the Quijos HPP project, there is no announced plan for the completion of construction, and there is recent plant growth at the construction site in December 2020 indicating a lack of construction, but stakeholders are supposedly discussing remedies. For the Mazar-Dudas HPP project, construction was initially halted due to legal disputes between CNEEC and CELEC. The contract termination for non-compliance is from construction cost overruns and local conditions at the site. The project is now estimated to cost 83 million USD, a 66% expected price increase, a significantly higher amount than the initial 41.6 million USD loan from CDB. During the construction, three Ecuadorian laborers died in an accident, where the workers were suspended by 80-meter-long ropes while drilling into the mountain when the rock collapsed. Similar to other BRI projects in Ecuador, Mazar-Dudas is accompanied by community development initiatives; however, there is no evidence that these projects have occurred, and they may have been halted by the sudden contract termination. For Quijos HPP project, CELEC found that CNEEC was not capable of maintaining technical quality and engineering standards due to numerous factors, including the firm's use of discontinued excavation methods, limited personnel, and lack of overall technical knowledge. This contract termination was supported by Ecuador's Public Procurement Service (SERCOP), which is, as of 2020, in mediation talks with CNEEC. Conclusion In 2007, Ecuador's then-President Rafael Correa made hydroelectric power a focus of his presidential campaign. This campaign promise would eventually take form as the resurrected Coca Codo Sinclair project, \"a centerpiece of his administration's energy plan.\" With Chinese investors' support, eight hydroelectric power projects and\/or dams were started, bringing Ecuador one step closer to generating enough energy to power the domestic grid as well as export regionally. It is important to note, while five of these projects have been completed, all \"have missed deadlines due engineering and environmental problems.\" Similarly, in 2009, Bolivia's then-President Evo Morales debuted the \"2025 Patriotic Agenda,\" which dictated Bolivia's goal of becoming the \"energy heart of Latin America\" and began the push for hydroelectric power in Bolivia. Both administrations welcomed the Belt and Road Initiative's infrastructure projects as a means to accomplishing their domestic energy development goals. In Ecuador, Correa's promise to invest in hydroelectric power and transform the domestic energy grid drove his administration to work closely with Chinese SOEs. This push, in some cases, came at the expense of the local environment, impacting biodiversity on land, water, and consequently impacting livelihoods. However, these projects, as shown by the analysis in our corecard, are overall less destructive towards the environment in comparison to Chinese-financed HPPs in Bolivia. There are still negative impacts, including Coca Codo's devastating oil spill and re-routing of the Coca River, but as a whole, there are fewer Chinese HPPs and\/or dams in Ecuador located in protected areas, fully disrupting river flow, and leading to deforestation. As a result of the environmental impacts associated with hydroelectric power projects and\/or dams, communities can be disrupted due to forced relocation and changes in river patterns. For example, in Ecuador, three of the projects displaced communities. Shifting to the positive, five of the projects were coupled with substantial community development initiatives that ensured local communities benefited from the projects in some way. These initiatives were mandated and implemented by Ecuador's CELEC. This stands in stark contrast to Bolivia, where no social development programs accompanied the BRI projects. Part of the gap between countries is attributable to the different approaches of their federal governments. Ecuador's federally-based strategy resulted in a more cohesive development strategy with additional oversight of projects, most visible in the contract terminations at Mazar-Dudas and Quijos sites when the projects were not up to Ecuadorian standards. In comparison, while Morales' Patriotic Agenda was outlined at a federal level, the domestic political turmoil in 2019 and 2020, eroded federal oversight and created a condition where local administration and interaction filled the vacuum. This shift is visible in the grassroots campaigns that successfully delayed multiple Bolivian HPPs. However, not all federal attention is positive: the intensive Ecuadorian federal interactions within the BRI projects set the grounds for corruption in Correa's administration. Since October 2020, new administrations have gained power in both Bolivia and Ecuador. The agendas of both administrations are not set in stone and both have the power to forgo HPPs in favor of a more sustainable renewable energy infrastructure and create a foreign policy less dependent on China. It is unclear what the United States' role will be in the quickly changing geopolitics and domestic politics in Latin America. However, at least in Ecuador, the United States has the opportunity to reinvigorate this diplomatic and economic relationship by building on the grant given in January 2021 and working with the new Lasso administration.

{"article":"Across the Tracks_ North Korean Railcar Manufacturing and the 2018 Inter-Korean Agreement.json","text":"North Korea's Economy  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Across the Tracks: North Korean Railcar Manufacturing and the 2018 Inter-Korean Agreement  In partnership with \n CSIS \n and written by \n Joseph Bermudez, \n Victor Cha, \n and Marie DuMond  Latest low activity at Chongjin railway factory  Impact rail connection part of 2018 joint declaration Published Jun 14 2018 4\u00a0years, 7\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  Connection and modernization of railways in the Korean peninsula's eastern transportation corridor is a declared step within the historic April 27, 2018 joint declaration for peace, prosperity, and unification.  Chongjin Railway Factory is one of two major railway manufacturing facilities in North Korea's eastern corridor. Analysis of this facility can be a brick-and-mortar sign-post of foundational infrastructure progress if the trust-building project of reconnecting the Koreas' railways is carried out.  Activity Railway manufacturing facilities have served as a necessary link in North Korea\u2019s underdeveloped economy, presently offer new possibilities in inter-Korean relations, and will be foundational infrastructure for future unification. However, knowledge of North Korea\u2019s infrastructure is lacking according to a pilot survey of regional experts conducted by CSIS Beyond Parallel. The following in-depth study of North Korea\u2019s railcar manufacturing infrastructure seeks to begin to address that void.\nWhile the Chongjin Railway Factory is currently active, commercial satellite imagery shows this activity is at a lower-than-anticipated level for a facility of this size and layout, suggesting shortages of raw material, energy, financial resources, administrative malaise, economic limitations, or any combination of these. Article  Timeline  Graphs  North Korea's railroad system, with over 7,400 kilometers (km) of track, is critical both to the North Korean economy and national defense, serving as the primary means for long-haul cargo and passenger transportation.1 Chongjin city, the largest city by square kilometers outside North Korea's capital, is a key part of this system as the most significant hub on the North Korea section of the freight rail line connecting Beijing, China, and Khasan, Russia, and one of a handful larger hubs in the domestic railway network. Most significantly, Chongjin is also home to North Korea's second-most active trading port, accounting for 24.2 percent of the country's import\/export activity in general cargo, agricultural goods, coal, and steel. The Chongjin port has a handling capacity of approximately 8 million tons, second only to that of Nampho in the southwest.2 It boasts the second-greatest length of dock space usable by commercial shipping in the country at approximately 2,888 meters. The railway factory located in Chongjin, therefore, plays a relatively unassuming, yet vital connecting role in the regional and national economies. As efforts progress to modernize and reconnect the eastern transportation corridor between North and South Korea under the April 27 Panmunjeom Declaration, the railcars produced and serviced at the Chongjin Railway Factory could play an increasingly important role. The Chongjin Railway Factory is one of just five major industrial facilities that undertake railcar production and depot-level repairs for the nationwide network. It is primarily engaged in the manufacture, repair, and scrap of railcars. Some small parts are likely manufactured within the factory, while others are scavenged from scrapped railcars or procured from local light industries. While the factory is active, commercial satellite imagery shows this activity is at a lower-than-anticipated level for a facility of this size and layout, suggesting shortages of raw material, energy, financial resources, administrative malaise, economic limitations, or any combination of these. The Chongjin Railway Factory (41.793718 129.796317) is located in the eastern section of Chongjin city and adjacent to the Chongjin Chongnyon Rail Station. As of February 2018, the Chongjin Railway Factory is an active repair and production facility and is being maintained at a reasonable level by North Korean standards. While there are approximately 140 railcars of various types present in the railyard, there are no visible indications of any significant new railcar production. This activity, however, could easily be missed if it is undertaken at a low level. There are no readily available reports of Kim Jong-un visiting the factory since he came to power. However, attesting to the facility's historical importance to the economy, a number of reported high-level visits to the factory have been undertaken by Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and other senior officials over the years. Furthermore, railcar manufacture and repair, as well as the Chongjin Railway Factory itself, have been frequently mentioned in North Korean media.3 Despite the importance of railway system and by extension its associated manufacturing facilities, outside knowledge of North Korea's infrastructure is lacking, according to a pilot survey of regional experts conducted by CSIS Beyond Parallel. When experts from the United States, South Korea, Japan, and Russia were polled, approximately 50 percent said they believed there was insufficient or no empirical analysis available on infrastructure. For example, of the South Korean experts surveyed, 46 percent said this of China, 50 percent of Japan, and 71 percent of Russia. Commercial satellite imagery indicates the primary type of railcars manufactured and serviced at the factory are gondolas and hoppers used primarily to haul mineral ore and coal from mines to heavy industries and powerplants in the province, especially the Songjin Iron and Steel Complex, Sonbong Thermal Powerplant, Kimchaek Iron and Steel Complex, and Chongjin Structural Steel Works. In turn, the Kimchaek Iron and Steel Complex and Chongjin Structural Steel Works provide the finished and semi-finished products to the Chongjin Railway Factory for railcar manufacture and repair. Aside from the movement of rail cars, few external changes of significance have been observed at the factory between 2006 and 2018 with the exception of the replacement of an assembly\/repair hall roof between 2016 and 2017, and the replacement of roofs on a second assembly\/repair hall roof and support building between 2017 and 2018. With regards to the movement of railcars, those positioned on tracks leading to the main assembly\/repair hall on the east side of the facility exhibit regular changes in numbers and types of railcars present. A number of tracks on the west side of the yard, apparently used to store railcars for scavenging spare parts and eventual scrapping, have railcars that have not moved in years. The imagery also shows piles of rubbish throughout the facility. However, this is somewhat typical of railroad facilities such as this and should not necessarily be taken as an indicator of level of activity. Obvious in any summer or fall imagery of the factory is that almost all open space at the Chongjin Railway Factory is used for gardening. While such gardening is typical of large industrial facilities in North Korea, the level seen at the Chongjin Railway Factory appears somewhat high which is likely an indicator of a reduced level of railway-related activity.

Declassified satellite imagery from January 1976, however, shows a facility that differs little in size and composition from that seen on the U.S. Army\u2019s 1946 city map. This suggests that the formal establishment of the factory may have occurred sometime after the Supreme People's Assembly held in December 1977 when Kim Il-sung established strategic direction and guidelines for railway development and railcar production.

Source: \n CSIS Beyond Parallel  Looking Ahead If, going forward, the April 27 inter-Korea agreement is substantially executed, Chongjin and its Railway Factory will be an area of focus given its role in the eastern transportation corridor. Furthermore, evidence of high-level visits to the site would be a significant sign of heightened priority being given by North Korean leadership to transportation infrastructure development and improvements.  Things To Watch High-level visits to the Chongjin Railway Factory by Kim Jong-un or other high-level officials. Presence of large numbers of newly manufactured railcars, an indicator of increased economic commitment to the facility and of future plans for the regional rail system. Seasonal decrease in gardening within the factory\u2019s open spaces, a potential indicator of an increased level of railway-related activity.

{"article":"The Sepho Tableland_ Changing Food Production in Marginal Areas.json","text":"North Korea's Economy  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors The Sepho Tableland: Changing Food Production in Marginal Areas  In partnership with \n Stimson\/38 North \n and written by \n Peter Makowsky, \n Jenny Town, \n Michelle Kae, \n and Samantha Pitz  Latest 100+ livestock farms constructed since 2012 Impact efforts to increase protein production Published Jan 21 2021 1\u00a0year, 11\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  The redevelopment of the Sepho Tableland is one example of North Korea\u2019s efforts to adapt its agricultural practices to perform better within the constraints of the land. This project sought to convert high elevation terrains, which are not conducive to crop production, into grassy fields for supporting livestock farming, thus increasing protein production while maximizing less than ideal land resources.  This project also demonstrated a culture shift in agricultural and consumption preferences. While pigs and chicken had historically been the preferred sources of protein, their grain consumption created higher demands on overall food production, diverting grain from the people. By shifting to grass-fed livestock farming, North Korea could increase protein production in a more complementary way.  Activity Conversion of the Sepho Tableland from suboptimal croplands to grass-fed livestock farms has been underway since 2012, with noted increases in activities in 2015 and 2016, when Kim Jong Un ordered construction to accelerate. Progress has been more gradual since then, but there are now more than a hundred livestock facilities in this region. What that translates into in terms of actual herds, however, is unclear.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  Background North Korea's topography, climate, and soil quality make its endeavors to be self-sufficient in food production a constant struggle. Despite being about the size of the US state of Mississippi, roughly 120,538 square kilometers, less than 20 percent of that land is arable. The majority of the country is rugged mountain terrain with dry conditions and poor soil. Even in the arable regions in the southern and west coast provinces, the climate dictates relatively short growing seasons. With already limited agricultural potential, the regime recognized around 2011 that its preferred livestock, mainly chicken and pigs, were also dependent on the country's agricultural production for feed, placing greater demands on overall food production. This realization led the regime to shift its focus, promoting instead the raising of grass-fed livestock, such as goats, sheep, rabbits, and cattle. This also led to a decision to shift farming practices in higher elevations, where soil and climate conditions were suboptimal, from crops to grassy fields for grazing. The Sepho Tableland Development Plan In 2012, North Korea initiated the transformation of the epho Tableland in line with a new strategy of turning \"grass for meat.\" It is an area covering over 30,000 hectares of land at elevations ranging from 300 to 600 meters, and stretching across the counties of Sepho, Phyonggang, and Ichon in Kangwon Province. Kim Jong Un provided an overview of the changes that were needed in the region in a speech about animal husbandry in January 2015, reported by the Pyongyang Times. While the climate and topography were suitable for grazing, the existing vegetation was not. Weeds and scrub bushes had to be reduced, and new grasses introduced that were scientifically selected to contain the proper nutrition for the livestock.\u00a0 Moreover, a whole new farming infrastructure was needed. This included housing, for the farmers and workers, as well as the animals, along with farm and community support facilities such as an animal and agriculture research facility, veterinary and anti-epizootic centers, and a livestock feed processing plant to ensure a year-round food supply for the animals. It also required healthcare and other social service facilities for the health and well-being of the farmers and workers. Finally, in order to get products to market, a meat and a milk processing factory were also planned, along with new roadways around the region. But the success of this initiative also required a culture change: moving people away from raising animals that eat grains toward grazing animals. In 2013, Kim Jong Un directed people not to keep domestic animals that eat stock feed, such as pigs and chickens, but rather to raise rabbits, sheep, and goats. Figure 1. Overview of Sepho Tableland. The Conversion Process Commercial satellite imagery, from 2013 to the present, show the transformation of the Sepho Tableland. Prior to 2013, this area was largely undeveloped with collective farms and little villages dotting the landscape. Many centered around the nearby towns of Sepho, Phyonggang, and Ichon-up. Those farming villages mainly consisted of individual homes enclosed by fences to pen in the family livestock. Collectively, these people would cultivate the adjacent fields, growing crops, which, for the for the most part, were incompatible with the lands. One of the first mentions of North Korea's plans to transform the tableland was in December 2012, when they were seeking ways to alleviate the country's perpetual food shortages. In the spring of 2013, imagery showed workers' construction camps began to emerge across the Sepho region, and by 2014, a new research facility and adjacent veterinary and anti-epizootic center were under construction. Additionally, livestock facilities began to emerge across the region.\u00a0 Kim Jong Un ordered further development of this region in a speech in January 2015, calling for the conversion of the Sepho Tableland into a \"large-scale livestock farming base,\" and for speeding up construction of \"houses, animal sheds, public buildings and other architectural structures and road work.\" The first of the livestock facilities revealed a basic construction design, which proved to be the basis for those to follow. A descriptive reference of these livestock facilities appeared in a Pyongyang Times article from August 13, 2016, which went into great detail about the types of housing being built, distinguishing them by function. It stated: The houses are eye-catching in particular. A mere sight of the roof tile color tells the viewer what kinds of houses they are. Those crowned with green roofing tiles are dwelling houses combined with animal houses, and those with red tiles are those for pasture keepers. The houses are flawless in every aspect such as structure, area and construction and each of them has a 5-cubic-metre methane gas tank. Fodder grass is dried and stored on the two-storeyed animal houses. The description of the roofing colors provides an indicator for assessing the project's growth in the region. The older homes and farms are drab in color, whereas the new facilities stand out with their brightly colored roofs that distinguish their functions. Satellite imagery confirms that there are fundamentally two basic livestock facility designs, which will be referred to as \"Type-1\" and \"Type-2.\" Type-1 is the earliest observed, dating back to 2014. These consist of a large, \"C\"-shaped livestock barn with a fence stretching between the two ends of the \"C,\" creating a large, subdivided animal pen. This allows the animals to move freely between the sheltered housing and the pens without going to pasture. These \"C\"-shaped barns have a caretaker's housing unit located on the open side, and two to three open-sided structures for harvested grasses located to its rear. The Type-1 structures can be a single unit located by itself, or a series of two or more located together, normally in a linear arrangement. Depending on the numbers of these facilities clustered together, additional housing units may be present. The common denominator for all buildings is their roof color, which appears to be a greenish color, indicating that the animal keepers reside on site per the aforementioned article. Figure 3. Exemplar Type-1 livestock facility with C-shaped design, October 2016. The Type-2 livestock facilities differ significantly. While their layouts vary slightly from each other, their elements are similar. They generally include two or more livestock barns arranged in a parallel configuration, with several linear fodder storage sheds, typically parallel to the barns (although some may be laid out in modified herringbone fashion). The telltale reddish roof coloring signifies that there is no caretaker housing collocated with them. Instead, the housing units for the \"pasture keepers\" are usually found nearby. They are arranged in clusters from as few as four to as many as eight units, with some of these housing areas having one or two additional \"services\" buildings collocated with them. Figure 4. Exemplar Type-2 livestock facility with parallel configuration of structures, September 2016. While there are two basic types of livestock facilities, their size, configuration, and layouts have changed slightly over the past several years. These changes are, presumably, a result of improved practices learned during this period. KCNA reported that the Construction Shock Brigade 922 had been assigned to support the construction of these facilities since 2012. The unit's presence was first observed on imagery from 2013, where the brigade's housing and support building could be distinguished by their dark blue roofs. These brigade camps were normally located adjacent to the housing, livestock facilities, or support-function buildings they were constructing. Figure 5. Construction Shock Brigade 922 near new livestock facilities, November 2016. With the arrival of the brigade and the beginning of construction, placards began to appear across the landscape, announcing the new initiative.\u00a0 Construction included new livestock facilities and housing units, as well as key facilities that were essential to the long-term success of the project. Among them is a livestock and agricultural research center, two veterinary and anti-epizootic centers, the Tableland Management Office, and a large processing plant complex for meat, milk, and feed. Figure 6. Tableland Management Office, September 2014. Figure 7. Future site of housing and large processing plant complex, April 2013. Figure 8. Housing and large processing plant complex under construction, June 2015. Figure 9. Overview of large processing plant complex, November 2020. Figure 10. Phyonggang processing complex. (Source: KCTV via Martyn Williams)  Figure 11. Phyonggang Livestock Feed Processing Plant. (Source: KCTV via Martyn Williams)  Figure 12. Housing area at Phyonggang complex. (Source: KCTV via Martyn Williams)  In November 2020, Korean Central Television (KCTV) released video of the Sepho region, showing an abundance of livestock, people working inside research laboratories, and the active interiors of the meat, milk, and feed processing plants. Imagery from the same month reveals the presence of animals at several livestock facilities or in their adjacent pastures. However, when the entire Sepho region is viewed, evidence of a bounty of livestock is not apparent. Instead, greater growing and harvesting activity is observed. This does not necessarily mean that North Korea has given up its vision for this region. On the contrary, while livestock facilities were constructed at a rapid pace, the acquisition and breeding of herds takes time, as several seasons are needed for herds to expand. Furthermore, slaughtering animals too early can also stymie growth. What we do see is that there are now well over a hundred livestock facilities dotting the Sepho Tableland landscape, and more continue to be added. It is therefore possible, that at some point in the future, the livestock population will reach North Korea's strategic target. How that achievement will impact the country's chronic food shortages, is yet to be determined. Figure 13. Research and veterinary centers, September 2016. Figure 14.

It is clear that the efforts to transform this region have been underway since 2012, which accelerated in 2015 and 2016, and have made gradual progress since then. However, while the infrastructure is largely in place, this does not mean it will generate immediate results. Seed animals are needed, followed by several breeding seasons for herds to grow; and slaughtering animals too early will stymie that growth. Further monitoring of various sources is necessary to determine what impact the Sepho Tableland will have on North Korea\u2019s overall food production.  Things To Watch Will additional livestock and support facilities continue to be built in the Sepho Tableland?  Will design changes to the facilities appear that would suggest adopting new techniques for grain efficiency? When might a notable increase of animal livestock be observed, both with the livestock paddocks and adjacent pastures? Will additional meat and milk processing factories be constructed, which would create greater capacity and suggest some level of program success? Will similar livestock facilities start to appear in mountainous areas of other provinces, as efforts to expand the \u201cgrass for meat\u201d initiative?

{"article":"North Korea Komdok Mining Region.json","text":"North Korea's Economy  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors North Korea's Komdok Mining Region: Empty Promises?  In partnership with \n Stimson\/38 North \n and written by \n Peter Makowsky, \n Jenny Town, \n Iliana Ragnone, \n and Ryan Kleissler  Latest mostly residential construction in mining areas Impact limited mining upgrades maintain under-performance Published Aug 15 2022 4\u00a0months, 4\u00a0weeks Image Credit  Go to map  Overview  In 2020, Typhoon Maysak ravaged North Korea's northeast provinces, devastating large portions of the mineral-rich mining region of Komdok. In the storm's wake, Kim Jong Un directed a plan to rebuild Komdok and transform it into a \u201cmodel\u201d mining community. Nearly two years later, the flood-damaged road and railway networks have been restored, and over 2,000 new housing units have been constructed. Despite those efforts, there is little evidence of actual plans to transform Komdok to \u201cmodel\u201d status beyond the new housing. Even that is a bit of a fa\u00e7ade, as speed has been emphasized over quality, raising concerns about their survivability. Without substantive investments, such as developing better transport networks or improving energy provision, the region will remain underperforming. Activity Despite instructions to transform the Komdok mining region into a model mining community, so far efforts have been largely focused on expanding housing and band-aid repairs from the 2020 typhoons. But the terrain and weather patterns of this region make even those efforts seem in vain without greater investment in infrastructure, energy provision and anti-flooding mitigation. Without such efforts, plans for the Komdok region appear little more than empty promises. Article  Timeline  Background North Korea is a mineral-rich country. While coal and iron comprise the largest deposits, the country is believed to have reserves of more than 200 mineral types, including zinc, gold, copper, magnetite, tungsten, graphite, and lead, as well as non-metallic minerals, such as magnesite and limestone. Estimates suggest that the country's mineral resources are worth trillions of dollars. These complexes cover a north-to-south distance of over 30 kilometers along the Puktae River and include the Pukdu and Muhak branch mines, the Taehung Youth Hero Mine, the Paekbawi Mine, the Kumgol Mine, the Komdok mines, the Ryongyang mines, the Tonsan Mine, and a number of smaller mines. However, the region's economic potential has largely gone unrealized for several reasons, including historical mismanagement of resources, outdated mining equipment and practices, an arcane and inadequate infrastructure, and seasonal flooding, all of which have hampered production. Moreover, North Korea's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons has brought about heavy international sanctions on the country's exports, limiting access to global markets. While mining has continued, there has been little evidence of efforts to improve the region's infrastructure or to increase output over the past decade, aside from post-flooding repairs and recovery. In 2020, North Korea's economic priorities appeared to shift. The borders had been closed to trade and travelers since January of that year to help prevent a major COVID-19 outbreak inside the country. As such, efforts and resources that had been applied toward the development of tourism and light industry for export were redirected to more domestically focused priorities and projects, such as the still unopened Pyongyang General Hospital and numerous housing projects. The Komdok region appears to be one of the beneficiaries of this shift. Kim Jong Un visited here for the first time in early September 2020, after Typhoon Maysak ripped through the region. He directed not only its swift recovery but further development into a \u201cmodel\u201d mining community. In a series of speeches, he emphasized the importance of Komdok to North Korea's strategic and economic objectives, citing critical products present within the region necessary to build the country's infrastructure, meet its growing housing requirements, and provide reliable supplies of food. As such, keeping these mines working was imperative. In the following weeks and months, repairs were made to the roads and rail servicing the region, and new housing sprang up along the valley (see figures 15, 16, 17). Additional new housing projects were also included as part of the five-year economic plan launched at the Eighth Party Congress in January 2021. But actual investment in the mines themselves and their supporting infrastructure such as new roads or rail lines\u2014efforts to truly improve Komdok\u2014were not evident. Overview of Major Mining Complexes About the Mines There are principally two types of mines in the region: open pit and underground. Open pit mines are surface mines. Typically, when an ore vein is located near the surface, tunnels are not necessary and other surface minerals are merely scraped away and set aside in piles of spoil. The ore is typically loaded onto trucks and hauled to nearby processing plants where further separation and refinement occurs. Underground mines are, in essence, tunnels bored into underground ore veins. The veins can be thin or thick layers beneath the surface and are reached through either surface entrances or adits located along mountainsides. Depending on the size of the vein, it can be accessed in more than one location, and if an ore layer is particularly thick, tunnels can cross one another, or even pass over or under another. In areas such as on a plateau, vertical shafts may be used to provide access to deeper target ore layers. Once the layer is reached, tunneling commences. Extracting ores from the mines can be through the use of trucks, ore cars on rails, conveyors, elevators, or a combination of these. Whether a vein is accessed vertically or horizontally, like the open pit mines, a processing plant is normally found nearby. In mountainous terrain, such as the Komdok region, lengthy, covered conveyors are often used to move the ore to the processing plants or to a railyard for transport out of the region. The Komdok Mines North Korea has the capacity to be one of the leading producers of zinc in the world. Zinc has a wide range of uses. On the industrial side, it is used to galvanize other metals and create alloys such as brass, nickel silver, and aluminum. On the commercial side, zinc oxide is used in a variety of manufactured products such as batteries, pharmaceuticals, plastics, and electrical equipment, making it a valuable commodity. One of the mines within this complex is located in Kumgol-dong, 50 kilometers north of Tanchon, and has estimated zinc reserves of 266 million tons of ore. It has been in operation since 1932 and is believed to be the largest zinc mine in East Asia. It is operated by the Korea General Zinc Industry Group, and extraction of zinc from raw ore is mainly done by a conventional flotation method conducted at Komdok's Dressing Plant No. 2. This plant is readily distinguished from other processing plants, by the large hillside flotation tanks, a necessary processing step for certain ores, and in this case, zinc. The Ryongyang and Taehung Mines Magnesite is the principal ore extracted from the Ryongyang (figure 6) and Taehung mines. The Ryongyang Mine is the largest in North Korea and one of the largest in the world and is located at Kumgol's southern edge. The Taehung Youth Hero Mine, located to the north, received particular recognition in 2011 when Kim Jong Il visited and praised its miners for their herculean efforts in exceeding their annual quotas. Magnesite is found in large quantities in the Tanchon area and has been extracted since 1980. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates the Ryongyang Mine to have a magnesite reserve of 600 metric tons and the Taehung Youth Hero Mine to have a reserve of 600 metric tons. However, production declined sharply in 2017, with the imposition of harsher sanctions in response to North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons testing. No real improvements have been made to either the political climate or physical mining infrastructure since then that would change the production outlook for these two mines in a more positive direction. Magnesite is mined in both underground (e.g., Ryongyang) and open pit (e.g., Pukdu Branch Mine) mines (figure 7). A key product derived from magnesite is magnesia, an important component in basic refractories, animal feed supplements, fertilizer, insulation material, cement, and several environmental control procedures. Structural Issues for the Komdok Region Flood Damage and Response Flooding, in general, is a persistent problem in the region. But when typhoons strike, devastating floods can occur, such as what happened in 2007, 2012, and 2020. Understanding the severity of the region's topography is necessary to appreciate how flooding affects this area, but this can be difficult to ascertain from two-dimensional satellite imagery. At first glance, what appears to be a network of shallow streams and rivers meandering through a mountain valley is actually a riverine system that cuts deeply through extreme mountainous terrain. Gaining access to these mining valleys was a challenge from the start. The roads and rail line that service the area, by necessity, follow the course of the river from the port city of Tanchon to points north of the Taehung mines. In several sections along the route, the roads and rail line hug the mountainsides, and pass-through tunnels have been constructed to shorten distances and reduce dramatic grade changes. Rail is the principal mode for moving the extracted ore to market, and therefore, maintaining the rail line is critical. With its steep topography, this region is not ideal for large-scale human habitation or the building of factories. In order to successfully mine the area, finding or creating level ground to accommodate housing and processing plants has been necessary. Most commonly used are the wide, raised areas along dry river bends and the occasional gentler slopes found near the river (figure 8). Adjacent mountain plateaus have also been used, but those areas tend to be far removed from transportation networks (figure 9). All of these locations come with risks, however. Seasonal rains commonly raise water levels and threaten facilities located in low-lying areas. To protect against rising water conditions, concrete flood walls have been constructed to help channel the water, and spoil from the mines is strategically placed to stabilize the riverbanks. But these measures, while effective against moderate, seasonal rains, often fall short against the more extreme conditions of typhoons. Building on plateaus would thus seem preferable, but being further removed from the transportation network and dressing plants comes with a set of challenges. Access to these elevated areas is confined to dirt roads that wind up steep embankments and are slow to traverse and subject to washouts and landslides. In addition, many of the local mining practices have exacerbated the potential for flood-related damage. For instance, much of the natural vegetation in the area has been stripped away as a result of the open pit mining found on the mountainsides along the river. During the rainy season, water runoff quickly mounts and can cause mudslides, which can damage buildings, roads, and rail segments. Another concern involves three land reclamation efforts along the river south of Kumgol (example in figure 10). There, the river has been redirected through tunnels, bypassing wide river bends, leaving dry, level parcels of land to build upon. While these tunnels were designed to handle normal water flow, even during the rainy seasons, imagery shows that the torrents of water accompanying typhoons have overwhelmed them, as a dam-like effect is created, and flooding ensues in the areas above and adjacent to them. In other words, the site selections are disasters waiting to happen. Flood Damage and Recovery: 2012 vs. 2020 In 2012, at the end of a particularly heavy rainy season, North Korea was hit by Typhoon Bolaven. With wind speeds over 100 kilometers\/hour, this caused widespread flooding and damage throughout the eastern part of the country. In imagery from after the storm, wind damage appeared to be minimal in terms of roof sections being lost. Housing closest to the river, in some cases, was washed away, but for the most part, structures remained intact (figure 11). This does not account for the level of water damage that was done to the building interiors, which would require imagery from the highwater-mark period to assess. However, in a few housing areas along the river, such as one south of the Ryongyang Mine, a number of single-story structures were eventually razed and replaced with multi-story structures, presumably from extensive flood-related damage. In 2020, North Korea was hit by back-to-back typhoons: Bavi and Maysak, wreaking havoc along the country's east coast and sparking the country's first-ever overnight live reporting (figure 14). In the Komdok region, the flood prevention measures put in place after the 2012 storm did not hold up to the series of stronger storms in 2020. More houses appeared to have been washed away accordingly, but the apparent \u201creal\u201d damage was to their interiors. Again, without imagery taken during the highwater-mark period, it is difficult to assess how many and how extensively homes were impacted. However, following Kim Jong Un's visit in October 2020, significantly more houses were razed and new homes built than what was seen in 2012. While damaged bridges were quickly repaired, evidence of washed-out roadbeds remained as bypasses were created. Following both storm periods, extensive work to reinforce flood walls and deposit spoil to build up the riverbanks was observed. The government's repair and recovery response within the Komdok region following the 2012 storm was similar to those following the 2020 storms, albeit not as pronounced in scope or scale. An exemplar is a housing area south of the Ryongyang Mine, where flood-related damage was significant, but the response was dramatically more extensive in 2020. In the aftermath of Typhoon Bolaven in 2012, North Korean media reported efforts to construct 1,000 new homes (figure 12), whereas 25,000 new homes were promised following Typhoon Maysak (figure 13). In each instance, the focus on roads and railways was similar, but the visible damage appeared less widespread following the first. It is unclear whether the repair efforts in 2012 included mitigation efforts against future severe weather conditions. If there was, it was inadequate for the force of Typhoon Maysak in 2020. After Typhoon Maysak in 2020, Kim Jong Un visited Komdok to evaluate damage from the floods and set forth new initiatives for the region, a plan aimed to transform the area into \u201cthe country's model mountainous city\u201d next to Samjiyon, and make the Komdok Mining area the \u201cworld's No 1 mountainous gorge city to be envied by all the people.\u201d He directed 25,000 new houses to be built in the Komdok Mining Complex, Taehung Youth Hero Mine, and Ryongyang Mine areas throughout the next five-year plan (5,000 houses per year). He also ordered a survey to properly design and rebuild the area to reduce flood risk in the future, stressing the need to dredge embankments, conserve trees and water, and build concrete retaining walls near roads and railways to protect against landslides and water damage. Imagery from that post-flooding period showed this activity was, indeed, taking place. Roadwork and bridge repair happened almost immediately (figures 15, 16), and new housing started in several areas along the Komdok river valley (figure 17). Some imagery revealed workcamps had been erected, and vehicles could be seen along the river. But the biggest, most visible transformation was the speed at which new housing units went up. Is North Korea Serious About Reviving the Area? It appears that most of Kim Jong Un's directives for the region are being met. During his initial visit to Komdok following Typhoon Maysak, he had set an October 10, 2020 deadline for the repair of roads, the rail line, and bridges, a promise which, for the most part, was fulfilled. In addition, the flood walls channeling the river were repaired, and spoil from the mines was used to build up the riverbanks. However, whether these measures will withstand a typhoon of a similar magnitude in the future is questionable. While the Komdok region holds enormous resources and earning potential for the country, the terrain and way the region has been developed make flood prevention and storm damage an unavoidable reality without serious investment in engineering, infrastructure, and equipment. Imagery shows that while the most favorable real estate has been allocated to the mining infrastructure, housing and public facilities sit on unstable ground, making living conditions for workers less than ideal, even with new homes. New housing construction continues at a remarkable pace, but the speed at which these units have been built, particularly those built right after the typhoon, has come at the cost of quality. Unofficial media reports have suggested major structural issues with the new homes. In one instance, residents complained that second-floor apartments had no water, forcing them to draw water on the first floor. Other issues reported include insufficient furnishings and deep worries about how they will hold up to future storms. Satellite imagery appears to support these concerns. For instance, some of the first housing complexes built after Typhoon Maysak were quickly built in a reclaimed river bend (figure 17). However, less than a year later, following the spring rainy season, standing water was observed in the streets, portending the risk of future flooding in the face of severe storms (figure 18). Despite this, further housing units continue to be added to this area with no visible mitigation efforts being put in place. Another example is the new apartments being constructed on slopes along the river. Previously, there were single-story units built in this area, where runoff furrows were clearly visible (figure 19). While a few of the early units were swept away during past storms, mud covered most of the remaining units, suggesting water likely passed through them, making them uninhabitable. Erecting modern, attractive apartment complexes may be visibly inspiring, but many of the runoff furrows remain, and there do not appear to be any efforts underway to redirect the water runoff away from the new housing complexes (figure 20). This suggests they are likely to suffer the same fate as the predecessor units, albeit perhaps with damage limited to their first floors. Modernization and Increased Production? Absent information provided through North Korean media regarding plant and mine modernization efforts and increases in production, detecting such changes or even verifying the reporting via satellite imagery is difficult without near daily collection to track movement and patterns of life. This is particularly true for monitoring fleeting items such as rail rolling stock and its cargo. Terrain changes at open pit mines caused by blasting and excavation of new pits can be subtle without a major effort being undertaken. Upgrades to processing plants and other factories tend to be longer-term in nature, but changes to building exteriors are merely an indicator of change, they do not necessarily provide clues as to what changes or upgrades might be occurring inside. Even assessing flood damage is limited to a structure's exterior, as the status of its contents cannot be seen. When a building is left largely intact following a storm, determining its operational status is ultimately left to exterior signatures such as smoke emissions and\/or products being staged outside. The Ryongyang Mine is an exemplar of the gradual change seen at the mining complexes in Komdok. Imagery taken in 2010 shows the mine and processing plant under expansion, with new, covered conveyors in place to move ore (figure 21). Imagery from after the 2012 typhoon shows that most of its mining facilities had been completed; however, the lower section of the conveyor, which crossed the river, had been washed away in dramatic style (figure 22). While repairs to the floodwalls were ongoing in April 2018, with reinforcements made after Typhoon Maysak, no attempts to repair the conveyor could be detected. In fact, imagery taken in 2018 revealed that the entire conveyor system had been removed (figure 23). It appears a new tunnel adit had been opened adjacent to dressing facilities to access the mines. What is not clear is whether the new tunnel entrance is accessing the same magnesite vein or whether the previous tunnel entrance, serviced by the conveyor, was to a separate vein, which has been near mined out, and the damage caused by the 2012 typhoon hastened the change. At the same time, other conveyors servicing other mines in the Komdok region, such as the Tonsan Mine, have also been removed. This may signal a change in mining practice, although conveyors are still present at the Kumgol Mine. Following Typhoon Maysak in 2020, imagery showed additional improvements to the flood walls were being made, and new spoil piles had been deposited along the riverbank in an effort to shore it up (figure 24). Given its relatively high location above the river, and despite the erosion of the riverbank, no visible damage to the mining facilities themselves was detected, save for the conveyor. With its removal and a new tunnel entrance, there had clearly been changes in mining operations, but the exact nature of those changes is unclear. Interestingly, however, covered conveyors were removed from multiple mining locations around 2018. So, perhaps new practices were being adopted across the region. As for the other mining complexes following Typhoon Maysak, most of the repairs seen in and around the mines have not been directly related to the mines, but rather toward the reinforcement of the river embankments and restoration of roads, bridges, and rail. Minor construction has appeared at the Taehung processing plant and the Tonsan Mine, although none that would suggest modernization. In Kumgol, two of the more notable changes include the addition of a workers' village adjacent to Komdok Mine No. 3, and five floatation tanks have been refurbished at the dressing plant, visible on imagery from March 2022. Moreover, the covered conveyor was removed. Rolling stock has returned to the railyard at Kumgol, confirming that it is still operational, but additional imagery would be needed to determine the impact on production (figure 25). An insufficient supply of electrical power has plagued North Korea for years, and the Komdok region is no exception. Inadequate energy sourcing has been a perennial problem, limiting the area's production, and claims of new processing techniques being implemented, reducing energy needs by half, cannot be substantiated. While changes to the energy infrastructure would be a key indicator of a commitment to increase operational capacity and improve the quality of life of the miners and their families, imagery taken over the last decade reveals few developments in this area. No new substations or power plants have been added, although some upgrades to existing substations may have occurred but were not detected due to limited imagery coverage. In an effort to improve energy provision to the northeast provinces, new hydroelectric power stations are gradually being added to its grid; among those are three power stations on the Namdae River. It is unclear whether any of these new stations have become operational or whether they will provide additional capacity to the Komdok mining community needs, but power lines do connect their location with a large substation south of Kumgol.1 References [1] First mentioned in Kim Jong Un's New Year's address in 2016, the hydroelectric Tanchon Power Station project is adding three new power stations to an area co-located with Hochongang Power Station No.1 in Suram-ni, which is located approximately 35 kilometers to the west of Komdok. While the power generated will service the broader region, a set of power lines do link the Tanchon power project to a major substation at Komdok.

For instance, hardening or paving the dirt roads would help improve access to the more remote areas. Building new rail lines to additional ports and distribution hubs, such as to the Nampo Port or to Namyong to facilitate land-based exports to China, would support broader distribution if and when prospects for exports improved. However, to actually increase production in this region and maximize its potential, consistent energy provision and the infusion of new and more modern equipment and methods are badly needed. Building this infrastructure, however, is not a turnkey process but rather a long-term endeavor. Moreover, planning for and implementing sound flood-prevention measures and protocols for this challenging terrain is necessary to truly transform Komdok into a \u201cmodel\u201d mining community and realize its enormous economic potential.  Things To Watch Will larger flood walls be constructed along the river to prevent flooding? Will additional new housing be located in more secure locations and provided with a transportation infrastructure necessary for the workers who live in them? Will efforts be made to stabilize the landscape bordering the road and rail network to prevent or reduce washouts? Will the number of processing plants increase, and\/or will existing plants be expanded? Will the number of electrical power substations increase, and\/or will the existing ones be expanded? Will we see an expansion of the port at the city of Tanchon to facilitate exports?

{"article":"North Koreas Cement Industry_ More Than Meets the Eye.json","text":"North Korea's Economy  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors North Korea's Cement Industry: More Than Meets the Eye  In partnership with \n Stimson\/38 North \n and written by \n Peter Makowsky, \n Jenny Town, \n Michelle Kae, \n and Samantha Pitz  Latest limited cement modernization observed on imagery Impact impacts construction down the supply chain Published May 17 2021 1\u00a0year, 7\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  North Korea\u2019s cement industry is central to achieving several of the goals set forth in the new five-year economic plan. Cement and concrete are necessary for improvement or expansion of tourist facilities, housing, roads, major construction projects, and even non-carbon electrical energy production. However, it is difficult to assess the industry\u2019s capacity, output, modernization and expansion. While North Korea is fortunate to have an abundance of the natural resources necessary to make cement and turn it into concrete, its cement industry has lagged due to poor quality control practices and dated production processes, often resulting in setbacks for the country\u2019s larger and more aggressive construction efforts. These problems will persist without actual modernization of the industry.  Activity Press declarations of cement-related modernization efforts and successes often do not match observable markers of modernization or success on imagery.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  Background For decades, cement has been the preferred building material in North Korea. Limestone, a key ingredient in making cement, is in great abundance, as is high-quality river sand, an aggregate for making concrete. Assessing the cement industry through satellite imagery, however, is a difficult task. Cement factories are typically located near the limestone mines they are dependent upon for source minerals and near railroads or major highways to facilitate transport to concrete plants located near the towns or major projects they serve. The larger factories also tend to be located near large metropolitan areas where the need for cement is greatest, but the limestone quarries also dictate their locations. Smaller cement factories tend to be located in more remote regions, servicing smaller projects and less accessible towns where transportation infrastructure is not as robust. While cement factories tend to have some unique signatures that can be observed on imagery, infrequent collection of many of these factories hinders the ability to closely and credibly monitor traffic and activity levels. Moreover, interior changes to factory buildings, where production processes may be modernized, are hidden from view. Despite these constraints, establishing some baselines about the status of the industry is still possible. Political Imperative for Revitalizing the Industry During the Eighth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) held this past January, Kim Jong Un laid out a five-year economic plan, including new tasks and targets for the construction field. He explained that the construction field \"should powerfully push forward the two fronts simultaneously--industrial construction for strengthening the economic foundations of the country and construction for meeting the material and cultural needs of the people.\"1 As a part of this new plan, the cement industry was specifically tasked with producing 8 million tons of cement and to \"ensure self-sufficiency of the finishing materials.\" Kim also called for the renovation of existing cement factories and the building of new \"large-capacity, up-to-date cement factories in the areas with favorable conditions for materials and electricity supply and transport, and thus further expand the cement production capacity of the country.\"2 While only a few months have passed since the new plan was announced, a plethora of national news articles has been published that tout stepped-up production efforts and the application of new technologies.3 So far, however, commercial satellite imagery has revealed very little that substantiates these claims, albeit with several limitations to what can be gleaned from imagery alone. Factory Signatures North Korean cement factories vary in size and layout, and thus they can be difficult to distinguish from other factories that also deal with mineral ores, as they often share similar design components. Therefore, it is important to know what components contribute to the making of cement, and of those, which provide unique visual signatures that when viewed in sum, can reveal the factory's purpose. While there are a number of factory components for the making of cement, six tend to stand out. 1. A nearby limestone quarry, where the rock is mined and crushed for transport. 2. Covered conveyors used to transport the crushed rock from quarry to factory. 3. A secondary crushing and grinding facility located within the factory complex. This building tends to abut or incorporate blending or homogenizing facilities, also referred to as proportioning facilities, where the ground limestone is typically mixed with clay, creating the meal. 4. Tall, preheating towers, where the raw meal is then moved through a long, inclined tube-like, rotary kiln, where the meal is turned into clinker. Of all the visual signatures of a cement factory, this is the most unique and likely to reveal the plant's function. 5. A large building or set of buildings, where the clinker is cooled and mixed with other products, foremost being gypsum, which is used to determine the setting time for the cement. It is there, where the mixture is then ground into its final powder form-- Portland cement. 6. A storage and shipping area, which typically includes packaging and storage buildings and storage silos for bulk cement. It is there where the product is loaded onto trucks or railcars for transport. Factory output, itself, is unfortunately difficult to determine. As mentioned earlier, North Korean cement factories tend to be located near limestone mines or quarries. Of those limestone deposits, all appeared to be active, but mines reveal little with regard to output, as rock is not stored in piles outside the mines, such as the case with coal and other ores. Quarries, on the other hand, provide subtle signatures of activity. Surface blasting is common, but the changes in topography following such blasts are rarely significant. Instead, the presence of power shovels and dump trucks are key indicators of ongoing activity. At the mines, rock is most often removed and transported to the factories via covered conveyors, thus precluding the ability to determine the amount of rock being moved. Even at open quarries, because of their proximity to the cement factories, covered conveyors are in use. Once reaching the factories, the rock is moved directly into crushing buildings and not held in open storage bins. With little stock generally observable within factory complexes, there are few means to measure activity levels. Liquid tank cars and gondola (ore) cars are typically observed at factory railyards, but their numbers can fluctuate significantly between images. Without frequent imagery, it is nearly impossible to determine production surges and then tying them to official news releases that boast increases in output. The same applies to the limestone quarries where, despite official media reports of large blasting efforts, the coinciding commercial imagery revealed little such evidence. Kim Jong Un's report to the Eighth Party Congress also addressed the introduction of new processes at cement factories designed to produce a better quality and\/or greater volume of product. In most cases, this change of production equipment occurs inside of existing buildings, and so unless a building is razed or another is added, such improvements cannot be verified through satellite imagery. Nonetheless, certain assessments regarding the health and size of the industry can be made, and these will be addressed by factory. The Landscape of North Korea's Cement Factories As one might expect, the largest of the cement factories are located near the larger population centers, where they can often be found in clusters. The southwest sector of North Korea is home to the most populated provinces and thus has the greatest demand for building materials. Included in this region are the Pyongyang and Nampo metropolitan areas. Download and interact with location files of all facilities analyzed in this study. oogle Earth KMZ and ESRI hapefile formats are available. Pyongyang Using Pyongyang as a central reference point, cement factories are arrayed around it with the majority located to the northeast, east, and southeast. Beginning 45 kilometers (km) to the northeast of Pyongyang is a cluster of three factories located just to the east of the city of Sunchon. These are the Pusan-ri, Puhung, and Sunchon factories. These appear to be \"showcase\" factories as they have ample housing and other amenities nearby. The mines and quarries which provide the raw materials for making cement are located nearby, the largest being the Jikdong Gypsum Mines.4 Of these three factories, Pusan-ri has undergone the most physical change in the past decade, where imagery shows the disassembly of its northern processing line began in 2011. Construction of new buildings, which appear to serve a probable administration or laboratory function, began in 2016 and was completed within a year. To the east of Pyongyang, three large cement plants can be found in areas between 18 and 27 km from the city. These include the Sungho-ri, Mandal, and Kumok cement factories. And going to the west of the city 15 km is the Kang-so Cement Factory. One of the largest cement factory complexes, the Sangwon Cement Factory Complex, is located 27 km to the southeast of Pyongyang and boasts a city-like layout. It includes a hospital, the Undok Health Complex, workers' dormitories, a tree nursery, a refractory cement factory, ordnance storage facilities, and a limestone refinery. A 2019 Pyongyang Times article highlighted the facility's efforts to modernize equipment and \"supply more cement to major construction sites including Samjiyon County, Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist area, Tanchon Hydroelectric Power Station,\" quoting its deputy chief engineer.5 Here, the only notable change within the Sangwon complex in the past decade has been the addition of seven high-rise housing units along the south side of the refractory cement factory. In the Sariwon area, located 60 km to the south, are the Kyongamsan Cement Factory, Madong Factory No. 1, and the Sariwon Concrete Railway Tie Factory. Of these, the Kyongamsan factory has seen the most visible change to its layout, mainly within the Cement Production Process area. In early 2011, many of the older, smaller buildings were razed, and new construction began in phases, all of which were completed by October 2013 and added significant capacity to the processing plant. Finally, another 30 km to the south is the Sinwon Cement factory. It is relatively unremarkable in size, but its location adjacent to a limestone quarry suggests it may have replaced the older Haeju Cement Factory, which is no longer in service. The Haeju Cement Factory is located at the seaside city of Haeju, 115 km south of Pyongyang. There, the factory was thriving until around 2004, but began to decline thereafter, and now appears to be abandoned. Its location by the sea is notable because it provided easy water access for shipping, although tide patterns likely impacted the size of the vessels able to use the port. While probably a location for shipping, there are no nearby limestone quarries, which also likely contributed to its demise in favor of Sinwon. Wonsan On the east coast, Wonsan represents the largest metropolitan area. It is an area that has seen a tremendous amount of growth in the last decade, particularly due to the promotion of tourism to the region, and specifically, the creation of the Wonsan Special Tourism Zone. Announced in 2014, the 400-square km tourist zone encompassed approximately \"140 historical relics, 10 sand beaches, 680 tourist attractions, 4 mineral springs\" with the goal of attracting much-needed foreign currency.6 Supporting the region is a cluster of four cement factories, Puraesan, the Chonnae-ri complex, Ryongdam, and the 618 Factory, all approximately 30 km northwest of Wonsan. The 618 Factory is the newest in the region, having been constructed between 2013 and 2014, a timeframe which coincided with the announcement of the Wonsan Special Tourism Zone. The northern part of the country is mountainous and less populated, and accordingly, the rest of the larger cement factories are in more isolated locations. The Manpho Cement Factory appears to be the largest from a capacity perspective. As its name suggests, it is located in the city of Manpho on the Yalu River. Its riverside access allows it to serve a larger area along the country's northern border, providing cement for the construction of buildings and the numerous hydroelectric dams that have been built both on the Yalu River and within the nearby river valleys. Unlike most of the country's cement factories, the limestone mine which provides crushed rock to this plant is located 3 kilometers upstream, and the rock is transported by rail to the factory. Another unusual feature of this factory is that there is open storage on site for the crushed rock before it is moved into the grinding buildings. Two other cement factories are located farther inland within a 70-km radius of Manpho. These are the Kanggye and Kophung factories. They are smaller in size and are likely major contributors to the construction of the many dams in the region. The Hyesan Cement Factory, located on the west side of Hyesan, is also on the Yalu River, approximately 160 km to the east of Manpho. While it supports the local metropolitan area and nearby projects, its location suggests that it is likely contributing significantly to the construction projects in the development of the resort city of Samjiyon. Finally, there are two cement factories north of Wonsan. The first, approximately 86 km away, is the Hamhung Cement Factory, a smaller plant that serves the local communities, including Sinpho. A cement storage facility, likely supplied by Hamhung, is located 75 km to the northeast on the sea, enabling the movement of cement up and down the coast. The last factory, the Kumusan Factory and adjacent limestone mine, is located 307 km north. Kumusan serves the northeastern most portion of the country, including the cities of Rason and Undok. Conclusion The tasked modernization and expansion of North Korea's cement industry underpins the success of several of Kim Jong Un's economic goals. While some growth and improvements over the past decade can be documented, signs of new construction or renovation of existing cement factories have yet to be observed. Since the Eighth Party Congress, North Korean state media has run several reports of factories exceeding their production goals and on the successful blasting of many tons of limestone rock.7 This suggests the industry is heeding Kim's direction in the short term, perhaps trying to demonstrate that it can rise to meet immediate demands, while it prepares for greater changes to come.8 Most recently, construction efforts have focused on major residential housing projects in Pyongyang.9 However, to date, none of these successes can be substantiated with imagery. Instead, the improvements observed are many years old, with the 618 Factory, completed in 2014, being the newest factory to be added and other modernization projects completed prior to 2017.

While increases in the cement industry's output are difficult to measure with satellite imagery, construction of new factories and\/or renovation of older factories are likely in the mid-term future to achieve the plan's production targets. However, whether this will improve the quality of cement produced or just increase the volume remains to be seen.  Things To Watch Will North Korea begin to expand or build new cement factories around areas where new, large-scale projects are being introduced to meet growing demand?  Will changes be made to factory layouts and designs that would suggest the addition of new or modernized production lines?  Will additional roads or rail lines be added around existing cement factories that would indicate greater output or new distribution routes? Will new cement factories be constructed around flood-impacted areas to meet housing demands as well as building of dams and levees to better control future flooding?

{"article":"Tracking the industrial growth of modern China with high-resolution panchromatic imagery and deep learning.json","text":"Machine Learning  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Tracking the Industrial Growth of Modern China with High-Resolution Panchromatic Imagery and Deep Learning  In partnership with \n College of William and Mary \n and written by \n Ethan Brewer  Latest Machine learning and Computer vision Impact Development and Analysis automation Published Jul 28 2022 5\u00a0months, 2\u00a0weeks Image Credit  Go to map  Overview  This study investigates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art deep learning models trained on high-resolution single-band satellite images in estimating site-level industrial development over time in the People's Republic of China. These techniques are contrasted with Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime lights as a proxy for site development. Activity Due to insufficient or difficult to obtain data on development in inaccessible regions, remote sensing data is an important tool for interested stakeholders to collect information on economic growth. To date, no studies have utilized deep learning to estimate industrial growth at the level of individual sites. In this study, we harness high-resolution panchromatic imagery to estimate development over time at 419 industrial sites in the People's Republic of China using a multi-tier computer vision framework. We present two methods for approximating development: (1) structural area coverage estimated through a Mask R-CNN segmentation algorithm, and (2) imputing development directly with visible & infrared radiance from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Labels generated from these methods are comparatively evaluated and tested. On a dataset of 2,078 50 cm resolution images spanning 19 years, the results indicate that two dimensions of industrial development can be estimated using high-resolution daytime imagery, including (a) the total square meters of industrial development (average error of 0.021 square kilometers), and (b) the radiance of lights (average error of 9.8 milliwatts per square meter-steradian). Trend analysis of the techniques reveal estimates from a Mask R-CNN-labeled CNN-LSTM track ground truth measurements most closely. The Mask R-CNN estimates positive growth at every site from the oldest image to the most recent, with an average change of 4,084 square meters. Article  Graphs  Introduction Satellite imagery analysis using deep learning methods, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has grown in popularity since 2012, with uses extending into the estimation of population, wealth, poverty, conflict, migration, education, and infrastructure, among other applications. These techniques have broadly illustrated that harnessing satellites to remotely track development over time in otherwise data sparse regions is a potentially effective strategy. One currently untested application of deep learning with satellite imagery is the identification and monitoring of industrial sites (e.g., factories, power plants, ports). The development of industrial sites is of broad interest, as it can serve as a proxy for everything from economic development to the projection of soft power. Because of its interrelationship with national security or proprietary corporate interests, information on such large-scale development is often undocumented or difficult to obtain openly by interested parties. This article focuses on testing our capability to automatically detect and monitor industrial sites within China using high-resolution panchromatic satellite imagery. Largely unrecorded in structured open source text information, the size and extent of industrial sites in China can be observed through routine or targeted satellite collection. From select sources, many locations appear, on average, at least yearly in cloud-free high-resolution imagery from satellite-based sensors over the past 15 years; some locations of interest have temporal granularity of as high as one day. To date, no work has explored the use of machine learning methods trained on satellite imagery to estimate, and monitor over time, the development of particular economic industries at the scale of individual sites. In this work, the primary research question we seek to answer is, `How accurately can a convolutional deep learning system estimate development at industrial sites from high-resolution panchromatic imagery? This article focuses on 2,078 images across 419 unique, known sites in the People's Republic of China from 2002 to 2021 (imagery access was supplied by NGA). Each image is labeled using a Mask R-CNN (MR-CNN) to estimate structure footprint coverage, based on a transfer learning parameter tuning approach with a subset of 182 manually digitized images. The MR-CNN's predictions on each of the 2,078 images are then used as labels for a CNN-LSTM (long short-term memory) to estimate the total area covered by structures. The ultimate goal of this study is to explore the potential of a technique that accepts as input a single satellite image and achieves the task of estimating a single, total building footprint metric for that image (i.e., we do not seek to estimate the spatial location of buildings, only their total coverage). This approach enables users to identify regions where rapid industrialization (or de-industrialization) may be occurring for more detailed, qualitative analyses. Data & Methodology The methodology and data utilized in this study are summarized as follows: 1. A MR-CNN is trained to measure the total area covered by structures using building location data from Shanghai (N=4,582 images) and fine-tuned with 182 high-resolution (ground sample distance ~0.5 m; a total of 545 million building pixels and 6.62 billion non-building) satellite images at known factories, power stations, and ports in China 2. The MR-CNN results are used to label 2,078 high-resolution (~0.5 m) images 3. 1,822 of the resulting image-label pairs are used to train a CNN-LSTM, with the goal of accurately estimating the total footprint of development at an industrial site over time (but, notably, not the explicit pixel locations of that development) 4. The effectiveness of the CNN-LSTM in estimating total structure area is tested on the remaining 256 images 5. Results are compared to training the CNN-LSTM using low-resolution satellite-derived nighttime light (radiance) values as labels, serving as a secondary proxy for development Fig. 1: The overall method is to use a fine-tuned object detection algorithm to generate labels for a CNN-LSTM estimation model of structural footprint area.

As shown in Fig. 6B, the backbone of the CNN-LSTM is a ResNet50 pre-trained on 10-band, 10x10 meter resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. During training and testing, each batch input into the network contains all (and only) the images of a single site. For input into the CNN, each image is downscaled, through bilinear interpolation, to 516 pixel height and 426 pixel width. These values are derived from the median image dimensions divided by 3.75 (a number converged upon through trial and error with GPU memory capacity). A second experiment is conducted in which only the least and most recent instances of each site are used, allowing for image dimensions of 1004x841. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, the CNN portion outputs to an LSTM, after which dimensions are reduced through three fully-connected layers. The final output represents the estimates of the total structural area for each instance of the site. Adam optimization and L1 loss are utilized to optimize parameters across the full architecture. A 75-12.5-12.5% split is carried out, with 1556 images used in training, 256 in validation, and 256 in testing. Fig. 7: VIIRS composites covering China from 2012, 2015, 2018, and 2021. Notice the overall increase in radiance between 2012 and 2021 at this scale.  To directly compare nighttime light estimations with those of the MR-CNN-based estimations, a linear model of the form A=m*NTL+b is conceived to approximate the structured area. NTL are the predicted nighttime light values from the CNN-LSTM or raw nighttime light values, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept. To build the linear model, values for area are obtained from 181 ground truth, geocoded images (with one site excluded due to an image being older than 2012). Results Table 2: Average precision, AP, of the MR-CNN at IoU thresholds of 0.3 for geocoded images from 2018-2021. Years before 2018 were excluded due to there being less than 9 examples of each.  Using the process outlined in \"Data & methodology\", the total area of structures contained in each image in the Maxar dataset is computed using the MR-CNN. Across the 2,078 images, the average structural area is 48,106 square meters with a standard deviation of 27,753 square meters. The average difference between the most and least recent instance of each site is 4,894 square meters. This compares to an average structure area of 82,909 square meters in the geocoded dataset, with a standard deviation of 72,963 square meters. Fig. 8: Validation loss vs. epoch during CNN-LSTM training on the entire dataset. The lowest loss occurs at epoch 271.  Determination of nighttime light values, as outlined in \"Data & methodology\", generates an average label of 13.0 milliwatts per square meter-steradian with a standard deviation of 21.5 milliwatts per square meter-steradian. The average difference between the labels on the most and least recent instance of each site is 3.1 milliwatts per square meter-steradian. Using these labels for CNN-LSTM training on the dataset produces an L1 loss of 9.8 milliwatts per square meter-steradian on the test dataset. Fig. 9: Results of linear regression performed (A) directly on the raw NTL labels, and (B) on the NTL predictions from the CNN-LSTM.  Analysis Table 3: The percent area change of each estimation technique on the 169 geocoded images covering 2018 to 2021.  Of particular note for our application is that, across our ground truth dataset, the total amount of land that was developed decreased. This is likely reflective of highly publicized industrial greening efforts being undertaken nationwide. As we are most interested in detecting these types of trends, it is important that the algorithm used for change detection is capable of identifying the correct trend (i.e., we focus on our ability to accurately predict the trend of development, not necessarily the accuracy of any individual absolute square meterage of developed land measurement). The average trends predicted are shown in figure 4.12, by technique; of particular note is that the MR-CNN-based CNN-LSTM method is the only method that predicts the decline contained in the ground truth. Fig. 11: Region (A) shows an industrial region in Jiangsu province (near Shanghai). Region (B) shows an area in Gansu province. The marker sizes represent the relative change in the structural area estimated by the MR-CNN CNN-LSTM at each site from its oldest instance to its most recent. Basemap is from geoBoundaries.org.  Limitations While the MR-CNN CNN-LSTM was the only technique able to accurately predict the negative trend in developed industrial land, it also opens the door to numerous future inquiries. The MR-CNN precision results suggest limitations in the use of single-band satellite imagery with current state-of-the-art segmentation models. Our precision values are in contrast to other examples of object detection from high-resolution satellite imagery where average precision values upwards of 0.94 at an IoU threshold of 0.5 have been reported. The relative ineffectiveness of the MR-CNN in this study most likely derives from the fact that the images contain a single band as opposed to the multispectral imagery most often examined in the literature. The differentiated color information encoded into multispectral imagery provides more information for the model to distinguish between similarly shaped features. For example, the inclusion of color is likely a key input in the estimation of buildings (grey, e.g.), ponds\/lakes (blue), and fields\/woodland (green). A common inaccuracy that occurs during inference is the prediction of fields, forests, and ponds as industrial structures. The labels and CNN-LSTM results derived from nighttime lights data show that 500x500 meter resolution VIIRS nighttime lights have difficulty capturing differentiation in development at the sub-km scale. Highlighting this is the fact that every NTL prediction by the CNN-LSTM on the 181 images geocoded set fell under 2.02 milliwatts per square meter-steradian (close to the median), despite there being significantly more range to the underlying values, as seen in Figs. 9A&B. This suggests there are no significant features present in the images correlating with their respective nighttime light values. Finally, this study would benefit from greatly increasing the number of geocoded images, for the MR-CNN, and for technique trend analysis. Increasing the number of geocoded sites, such as geocoding two instances of each site, would provide more robust information for the MR-CNN to train on and, at least as importantly, allow for tracking the ground truth development at specific sites (to then contrast estimation techniques with). Conclusion In answering the research question, how accurately can a convolutional deep learning system estimate development at industrial sites from high-resolution panchromatic imagery, the work presented in this article provides three core contributions to the literature. First, we offer a comparison of the effectiveness of various techniques for remotely estimating development at industrial sites using deep learning and satellite data. Second, we discover that the resolution of current nighttime light sensors is generally insufficient to resolve development at the scale of individual industrial sites. Third, we provide evidence panchromatic imagery is relatively not well-suited for CVRS object detection tasks. A CNN-LSTM is able to resolve structural area and radiance to approximately 0.021 square km and 10 milliwatts per square meter-steradian, respectively, at the tested industrial sites in China. The estimations from the NTL-based model approximate structural area with an R-squared of 0.01, with the raw labels alone approximating with a higher R-squared of 0.1 (Fig. 9). As seen in Fig. 10, the hand-geocoded information reveals more recent images of industrial sites have less structural area on average, a result driven by small sample size or actual deindustrialization efforts by China. MR-CNN-based CNN-LSTM estimations reflect this trend, but NTL labels, MR-CNN labels, and NTL-based CNN-LSTM estimations do not. The labels generated by the MR-CNN, and the resulting predictions by the CNN-LSTM trained on those labels, indicate widespread growth over time when each site is tracked individually (average change of 4,084 square meters), as illustrated in Fig. 11.

Looking Ahead The contributions provided in this study provide meaningful future directions for related work. One such direction would be to test the methods detailed here with multispectral imagery, if available for these locations, or at locations where multispectral imagery is more readily accessible. Second, using the methods and imagery in this study, there may be significant improvements in MR-CNN (or related algorithm, e.g., U-Net) performance with a substantial addition to the number of carefully geocoded sites. A greater number of geocoded sites would also increase the sample size of ground truth observations allowing more robust trend analysis of the various prediction techniques. Finally, topographic data such as digital surface models (DSMs) may be particularly useful as an additional model input to capture change in the built environment.

Activity GEOINT analysis confirms construction and expansion of the base consistent with public declarations, but claims that major air defense systems have been moved to the base have not been observed on imagery.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  Introduction In April 2017, Russia unveiled an Arctic Trefoil military base on Alexandra Land Island in the northeast Barents Sea. It is Russia's northern-most military outpost, and the second of its kind following the completed Northern Clover on Kotelny. Alexandra Land is also home to the upgraded Nagurskoye Airbase. Rather than ensuring these new Arctic bases remain secret, the Russian government is encouraging virtual tours of its state-of-the-art, three unit clover-like compound which is designed to withstand severe weather. Russia's military posture on Alexandra Land provides air, sea, and land capabilities which reinforce Russia's multi-layered maritime and air denial capabilities; safeguard the Kola Peninsula which is home to Northern Fleet headquarters and Russia's advanced Arctic land, air, and naval assets including its nuclear arsenal and second-strike capabilities; and ensure Russia's access to and control over the Northern Sea Route. Geographically, Alexandra Lands proximity to the Greenland-Iceland-Norway (GIN) and Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) gaps and its increased capabilities could disrupt NATO's vital sea lines of communication (SLOC) between North America and Europe, hindering U.S. military reinforcement to Europe. Background Alexandra Land Island (Ostrov Zemlya Aleksandry) is the largest island in Russia's Franz Josef Land Archipelago (Zemlya Frantsa-Iosifa), and its strategic importance to Russia's national defense and presence in the Arctic dates back to the early 1950s.1 During the Cold War the former Soviet Union established and maintained the Nagurskoye Airbase, which included the 31st Separate Radar Company, a meteorological station, a small dirt\/snow airfield (known as the Nagurskoye Snow Strip), and likely small signal and communication intelligence collection units. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, these facilities were substantially reduced to a FSB [Federal Security Service] border post (30 persons), Arctic specialists (16 persons) and meteorologists (six persons) who lived and work there.2 An important shift in Russia's military doctrine in 2008, which elevated the strategic importance of the Arctic, revived Alexandra Land's importance to the Kremlin. The reconstitution of the Nagurskoye airbase and construction of new facilities better secures northern approaches to Russia's coastline, protects its vast mineral and energy resources, and improves monitoring of maritime shipping activity across the Northern Sea Route. President Putin personally visited Franz Josef Land in April 2010 following a maritime border demarcation agreement in the Barents Sea between Russia and Norway, paving the way for oil and gas exploration along the maritime border. Five years later in 2013, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that would reestablish a regular naval and military presence in the Arctic.3 As part of its plan, the meteorological station on Alexandra Land would be supplemented by the addition of permanent military facilities that would include a new airbase, housing and administration trefoil, air traffic control and air defense units and radars, and other support installations.4 Alexandra Land Island (June 31, 2013) Alexandra Land Island (July 22, 2016) Alexandra Land Island (March 19, 2019) Construction moved quickly, and in November 2014 units of the Northern Fleet's air defense division deployed to Alexandra Land and were housed in a temporary camp.5 The following month construction of the housing and administration trefoil began. In October 2015 Northern Fleet Commander Admiral Vladimir Korolev stated that construction of the trefoil was 60 percent completed.6 By the fall of 2016, the trefoil compound was completed.7 Housing and Administration Trefoil Area (June 30, 2013) Housing and Administration Trefoil Area (July 22, 2016) Housing and Administration Trefoil Area (March 19, 2019) In April 2015 it was announced that a new 2,500-meters-long temporary seasonal airfield covered with ice would be constructed on Alexandra Land to accept delivery of personnel and cargo.8 The following year, it was announced that this new airfield would be extended to a Class 2 year-round runway [and would] have dimensions of 2.5-kilometers-by-42-meters and be completed by the end of 2016.9 That same month Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that a group of either Su-34 multirole fighter aircraft or MiG-31 fighters would be based at the new Nagurskoye Airbase, alongside Il-78 tankers.10 When completed, the airbase and air units would consist of heated hangars for Su-34 or MiG-31 aircraft, an aviation headquarters, a separate radar company, air traffic control facility, antiaircraft artillery battalion, and communications and support sub-units. Nagurskoye Airbase would be capable of receiving and basing of all type of aircraft, including strategic bombers, and defending itself.11 Nagurskoye Airfield (July 22, 2016) Nagurskoye Airfield (March 19, 2019) With the upgrade to Nagurskoye Airbase, Russia has established a new air defense division in the Arctic which includes the units on Franz Josef Land (to include Alexandra Land Island), and units on Novaya Zemlya, Severnaya Zemlya, the New Siberian Islands, Cape Schmidt, Wrangle Island and Tiksi, covering an area of approximately 4,800 km.12 Analysis Location, Location, Location Alexandra Land's location advances two Russian objectives in the Arctic: (1) it enhances Russian territorial defense and (2) improves monitoring and control over maritime activity across the Northern Sea Route. As its northern most military installation, Alexandra Land pushes Russia's military and forward line of defense further north into the Arctic Ocean, making it a key outpost to observe NATO activity and capabilities. Considering that the four other Arctic coastal states are NATO members, Alexandra Land effectively represents a marker, stymieing what Russia may interpret as NATO expansion in the region. The Sopka-2 radar system improves Russian air and maritime domain awareness in the Arctic and supplements Russia's strategic early warning radar network to detect U.S. or NATO aircraft and missiles when flying over the top. Sopka-2 Radar and Communications Installations (June 30, 2013) Sopka-2 Radar and Communications Installations (July 22, 2016) Sopka-2 Radar and Communications Installations (March 19, 2019) Similar to the Sopka-2 radar installation on Wrangel Island, Alexandra Land is part of a larger network covering Russia's northern border in the form of a protective dome against foreign aircraft, missiles, and ships. Alexandra Land is also situated along the Northern Sea Route. In anticipation of increased maritime activity, the Russian government increasingly seeks to enhance its surveillance, enforcement, and defensive capabilities along the route. There are also growing concerns about potential military activity. In March, the Russian government imposed limits on foreign warships transiting the NSR, requiring 45 days notice for voyages. This new limitation runs counter to international maritime law as the majority of the international community views the NSR as an international passage meaning freedom of navigation should be permitted, although it is rarely tested in the Arctic. This is a concerning development that could hinder the conduct of innocent passage through the NSR. Defending Against \"Over the Top\" Threats Alexandra Land plays a critical role in protecting the Kola Peninsula, home to the Northern Fleet headquarters at Severomorsk. The Kola Peninsula is a vital center of Russia's military power because of its modernized nuclear submarine fleet and nuclear missiles and conventional long-range high-precisions cruise missiles. Multiple layers of defense consisting of maritime and land capabilities serves two crucial functions: denying access to foreign naval forces and ensuring the survivability and second-strike capability of strategic ballistic missile submarines.13 The Kola Peninsula is increasingly fortified by Arctic outposts like Alexandra Land which develops military supremacy out to the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) gap while strengthening Russia's bastion defense capabilities. Displaying its growing military strength in the Arctic, in June, Russias Northern Fleet tested the Tor-M2DT missile system, with a missile range of 15 kilometers. According to reports, the Tor-M2DT is likely to be deployed to several remote military installations, including Franz Josef Land. Tests of the new system follow reports of past deployments of notable air defense assets including the S-300 (NATO: SA-10 Grumble) air defense system and the Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft system. Complimented by the rumored presence of K-300P Bastion-P (NATO SSC-5) coastal defense systems armed with P-800 Oniks anti-ship cruise missiles (NATO: SS-N-26 strobile) and 4K51 Rubezh (NATO: SSC-3 Styx) anti-ship system, Alexandra Land would be a center point of a developing A2\/AD bubble extending into international waters of the Central Arctic Ocean and Barents Sea. However, none of the satellite images analyzed capture such equipment. But We Can Speculate About Power Projection Scenarios While Alexandra Land's primary function is to enhance Russian air and coastal defense, the growing military capabilities on Nagurskoye Airbase suggest that Alexandra land could be a staging location for future offensive and power projection capabilities. Following the upgrades in 2016 to a Class 2 year-round runway, Nagurskoye Airbase is now capable of hosting fighter and refueling aircraft, notably Su-34 and MiG-31 fighter jets and Il-78 refueling tankers. Based on a 2018 Danish Intelligence Risk Assessment, Russian aircraft based at Nagurskoye Airbase are capable of reaching the airspace over north-eastern Greenland with little prior warning. Supported by air-to-air refueling, Russian combat aircraft could reach Thule Air Base, a key installation in the U.S. space and missile defense architecture while also enlarging Russia's A2\/AD bubble into the North Atlantic. Estimated combat aircraft range from Nagurskoye Airbase without and with air-to-air refueling. Source: Danish Defense Intelligence Service; CSIS The size and scale of recent Russian exercises in the Barents and Norwegian Seas suggest that it seeks to practice and test its expanding defense capabilities in the North Atlantic. In August, the Northern Fleet completed a comprehensive naval aviation exercise involving more than 50 aircraft, including fighter jets, bombers, Tu-142 anti-submarine planes, Il-38, MiG-31, Su-33 and Su-24 fighter jets in addition to nearly 2,000 ground personnel. The maritime component of the drill included 30 Russian naval vessels including surface ships, submarines, and supply ships. Norwegian Chief of Defense Haakon Bruun-Hansen suggested these are exercises designed to block NATO's access to the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Norwegian Sea, hindering NATO reinforcements to Norway. Importantly, Russian forces for this exercise emanated from Russia's Northern, Baltic, and Black Sea fleets, suggesting that NATO should reconceptualize its understanding of how Russia will defend the Arctic and what resources NATO would draw upon to defend its allies. Conclusion Alexandra Land and Nagurskoye Airbase increase Russia's air and maritime defense capabilities in the Arctic. The most concerning aspect, however, is Alexandra Land's potential as a staging ground for power projection into the Central Arctic and North Atlantic. The Trefoil compound and its support facilities raise the level of readiness of Russia's Arctic forces potentially to the point where Norway's freedom of action and movement is restricted and potential Allied access to the North Atlantic is cut off. Sending NATO reinforcements to defend Norway would prove challenging, and NATO's freedom of navigation in the Arctic could be reduced. At the moment, however, the satellite imagery does not indicate such an expansion is occurring or capabilities are present. The ongoing Russian military exercise, Tsentr-2019, should provide greater insight into new Russian Arctic capabilities as well as Alexandra Land's role in Russia's bastion defense. There are reports of significant quantities of deliveries to Franz Josef Land prior to Tsentr. The U.S. and NATO must closely monitor and analyze the Tsentr exercise to examine shifts in and changes to Russia's Arctic military posture. References and Notes 1.

{"article":"Predicting Terrorism in Europe with Remote Sensing, Machine Learning, and Spatial Statistics.json","text":"Machine Learning  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Predicting Terrorism in Europe with Remote Sensing, Machine Learning, and Spatial Statistics  In partnership with \n St. Louis University \n and written by \n Caleb Buffa  Latest compares non-territorial and separatist terrorism Impact terrorism modeling refined with spatial dimensions Published Feb 16 2022 10\u00a0months, 4\u00a0weeks Go to map  Overview  This study defines and parses the differences between territorial \/ separatist terrorism versus non-territorial seeking terrorism from a spatial and geographic perspective. This spatial\/geographic component of the research is foundational due to prior research often focusing on the motivations of terrorism rather than spatial and geographic perspectives. Activity The complexity of terrorist target selection is often minimal. The inferential interpretation of previous research can often predict the vulnerability of target areas. For example, non-territorial terrorists often target the same types of areas. However, this study shows that territorial terrorists (separatists) are more difficult to predict. They often operate in peripheral environments within geopolitical conflicts. This study found the coefficient of the standard deviation of nighttime lights per 5-km grid cell (showing electrification) to be strongly and negatively correlated with the presence of terrorist attacks, suggesting as an area becomes more scattered with lights (diverse) the less likely non-territorial terrorists will attack. Drawn out further for future study, what does this mean for separatist terrorism? Article  Graphs  Introduction A 2013 meta-analysis of counter-terrorism studies noted the majority of research focuses on political and sociological perspectives with little focus on geographic ones. However, if government policies are designated within a defined territory, terrorism can, in some part, be understood as an attempt to influence control over political boundaries. Similarly, strong links between a lack of territorial security and the presence of terrorism have been found as a lack of governmental control enables terrorists to view the environment as permissive to their acquisition of an autonomous zone. Further, high population areas and those of governmental importance are both attractive and cost-effective targets while cities of high regard increase their appeal. A terrorist's specific motivations also have a geographic component, exemplified by religious groups targeting places of worship; right-wing terrorists selecting governmental buildings; persecuted individuals seeking out civilians in everyday locations; and territorial terrorists operating in peripheral environments. There is even a self-reinforcing cycle in which areas previously attacked become increasingly attractive to future attackers and a relationship between the terrorist base of planning and preparation suggests target locations are a function of geographic convenience as much as an act of coercion. In efforts to predict terrorism, a number of methods have been employed including Hidden Markov Chains, feed-forward Neural Networks (NN), ensemble models, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These models have been applied to identifying deceptive behavior, predicting attributes of terrorism, and even the region in which terrorism is likely to occur with results ranging from 60 to 95% accuracy. However, while such previous work has reported robust results, few studies have focused specifically on remote sensing and spatial sciences. While one author included nighttime lights and digital elevation models in their research, it is still not well understood how these variables contributed to the results or the spatial accuracy. This research aims to predict terrorism in Europe at the sub-national level. Objectives of the research are: (1) develop a model to predict terrorism using satellite imagery and socio-environmental data and (2) develop a grid-cell-based spatial statistics approach to reveal specific causal variables and trends in this region at a previously unexplored spatial scale. Methods This study includes 18,741 attacks occurring between 1970 and 2018 in Eastern and Western Europe apart from Russia. The target feature was developed from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The GTD is an open-source data set of terrorist incidents since 1970 that has been geo-referenced, matches the definitional criteria of the study, and has been the primary source of terrorism studies in the United States. Remotely sensed data was collected from a variety of sources including the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, 2020 Copernicus land cover, and 2018 nighttime lights from the Visible and Infrared Imaging Suite (VIIRS) sensor on board the Joint Polar-orbiting Satellite System. Geospatial and population features were collected from WorldPop, a peer-reviewed research data archive. From this archive, data was obtained on distances to major waterways, inland water, major road intersections, roadways, population counts, population densities, built settlement growth, and demographics from 2000 to 2020. Civil unrest was calculated from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data set (ACLED). It should be noted as a limitation, however, that this study covers terrorism until 2018 (the last year GTD has data available at the time of the study) while civil unrest is calculated from data beginning in 2018, the earliest year ACLED has data available at the time of the study. It is therefore assumed this feature is representative of larger civil unrest during the study's time period. For spatial-temporal analysis, the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS), which documents sociopolitical interactions extracted via open-source documents, is used. Shapefile boundaries were imported from the Department of State International Boundaries data source and ACLED data was imported as vector points before being converted to raster format at a 10 km ground sampling distance (GSD). Pixel values were calculated as the number of events occurring within the GSD. Next, 5 square kilometer hexagonal cells were created within the area of study and vector points placed at the centroid of each polygon. Points falling within a 3-km buffer of attack locations were removed. The spatial resolution for each observation is therefore approximately 5-km. Study area (a) and sample rasters from which training data was produced, including (b) elevation, (c) land cover, and (d) distance to major road intersections.  The 23 Copernicus land cover classifications were aggregated into urban, vegetation, agriculture, and water. The data was then split into training (0.7), evaluation (0.15), and hold-out test splits (0.15). Evaluation data was used for comparison and hyper-parameter tuning while the hold-out test set was used only for final performance assessments. An unpruned Random Forest of 100 trees was fit to the training data and permutation importance used to retrieve feature importance scores from the evaluation set to understand each feature's generalization. This methodology performs robustly on random values, datasets containing both categorical and binary features, as well as in the presence of collinearity. Features with lower feature importance and correlation coefficients higher than 0.7 were removed apart from binary and categorical features and data was normalized to a 0 - 1 scale resulting in the following features used for prediction: (1) distance to inland waterway, (2) distance to major road, (3) distance to major waterway, (4) elevation, (5) civil unrest, (6) population density, (7) slope, (8) nighttime lights, as well as (9) urban and (10) agricultural land-cover. Five machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated for comparison as each maintains specific strengths and weaknesses specific to this study. Logistic regression's ability to map probabilities, robustness to skewed distributions, and intuitive coefficient interpretation, has proven itself in the face of more complex tools such as Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks. This model was optimized with stochastic gradient descent, leveraging an alpha value of 1 x 10-6 and an initial learning rate of 0.1 producing an 87% F-1 score. By aggregating the predictions of multiple weak decision trees, the Random Forest classifier is likely to be an ideal model for this topic as it has found success among co-linear features, is largely unresponsive to over fitting, and provides impressive performance in handling categorical and continuous variables, unbalanced data, and outliers, all of which are present. This model leveraged a max depth of 3 trees, Gini impurity, and considered a maximum of 3 features for each split resulting in an F-1 of 96%. Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are well known for the kernel trick, delineate non-linearly separable data by mapping data points into an n-dimensional kernel to avoid the computational costs of calculating n dot products in a 3-D feature space. The primary parameters of the Radial Basis Function kernel, gamma and C, were sampled from logarithmic grids. However, despite the kernel tricks' success, SVMs are computationally expensive as fit times increase at a quadratic rate with the number of observations. As a result, ten SVMs were trained in a bagged ensemble. Each child estimator was exposed to a random sample of 0.1 of the training data set without replacement, decreasing fit times while improving generalization. This model, leveraged a C and gamma of 1.0 and .0069, resulting in an 87% F-1. Neural networks comprise an arbitrary number of layers connected by an arbitrary number of neurons allowing them to learn non-linear decision boundaries via activation functions. The size of the model, both in terms of width and depth, impacts the level of complexity that can be learned. However, larger models often degrade in performance past a consistent depth due to the number of matrix computations. Therefore, it cannot be stated that a deeper or larger model will necessarily perform better, only that with proper techniques to avoid vanishing gradients and over fitting, it will not likely perform significantly worse. The shallow NN obtained from Uddin et al. 2020 consisted of a single hidden layer of 10 neurons with an initial learning rate of 0.001, 500 epochs of training, Adam optimization, logistic activation function, and cross-entropy loss. The DNN leveraged the same hyper parameters as the single layer NN but with 5 layers consisting of 100, 50, 30, 10, and 5 neurons. The neural networks achieved a 0.91 and 0.92 F-1 score respectively. Results Table 1 compares the results across accuracy, average precision computed from precision-recall curves, and F-1 scores. Average precision and F-1 were chosen as the evaluation metrics due to their robustness in the face of large class imbalances. Each model performed exceptionally well but the Random Forest outperformed every other across all tasks. Spatial statistics were then used to validate the Random Forest's spatial accuracy. Join counts were used to assess the spatial correlation between the classifier's predictions. We can understand spatial processes and distributions as one of many, or potentially infinite, possibilities. Therefore, by modeling random distributions, join counts compare synthetic results with ground truth to assess the likelihood of geographic correlation among predictions. With a synthetic p-value of 0.191, the Random Forest did not demonstrate a statistically significant correlation among incorrect predictions at large. With a high simulated p-value, this research can reject the null hypothesis that the results were clustered, and thus, spatial correlation is not occurring among incorrect predictions at large. However, the model did exhibit significant spatial correlation in terms of false-negative predictions with a synthetic p-value of 0.001. Further analyzing terrorism's spatial relationship, a Poisson regression found the coefficient of the standard deviation of nighttime lights per grid cell to be negatively correlated with the presence of terrorism (98% significance), suggesting the similarity of an area's economic development and population density may be a driving factor in target selection. Nonetheless, a lack of statistically significant spatial-temporal correlation between geo-referenced sociopolitical publications and attack locations suggests more research should be done to parse when attacks are likely to occur where they do. Finally, a DBSCAN model identified clusters of false negatives in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, Northern Ireland, Kosovo, the Basque country of Spain, and the island of Corsica, France. Discussion Although the best performing model, Random Forest, predicted false-negative clusters, it revealed an underlying trend: each cluster is a hot spot of terrorism in which territorial control was the primary grievance or objective. As noted earlier, Northern Ireland saw increased levels of ethno-nationalist conflict from the 1960s to late 1990s; the Basque area of Spain also saw armed conflict from the 1960s to early 2000s between Basque organizations who sought independence; Kosovo, underwent a massive upheaval with respect to autonomy in the 1990s between Yugoslavia and Kosovo nationalists; Corsican nationalists have fought French, Italian, and Spanish security forces regarding independence from France. Most recently, conflict in the Donetsk region of Ukraine stemming from the 2014 Russian invasion has resulted in Russian separatists fighting for annexation into Russia. While non-territorial terrorists target highly populated urban areas with symbols of their grievance, separatism is a function of operating on the periphery where the current government does not retain high degrees of control. These locations are likely to occur outside of the most populated areas that are typical of other types of terrorism. This likely explains the clustering but highlights the geographic differences between these types of terrorism. Further, the lack of clustering among non-territorial terrorism suggests sub-classes of terrorists (right-wing, left-wing, environmental, etc.), maintain similar geographical logic and planning. Thus, it may be more appropriate for future studies to examine terrorism in terms of its territorial or non-territorial nature rather than the specific issues that drive them. These findings can play an important role in counter-terrorism analysis. First, given Random Forest's outperformance of more complex models, it can be inferred that the complexity of terrorists' target selection is not high as it can be deduced from an ensemble of decision trees. In fact, these results indicate that areas analysts often believe to be likely targets based on the common intuition and established literature are, in fact, the most likely targets. Additionally, no significant spatial-temporal relationship between ICEWS and GTD data was found, suggesting that terrorists are not likely to be mobilized by the larger sociopolitical discourse. It can be inferred that terrorists are either uninterested in public conversation or are largely disassociated from it. If the former is true, terrorism may be a marketing campaign of sorts, aimed at moving the direction of conversation towards an area of their favor. If the latter holds, then more research should be done to collect the interactions terrorists are interested in. Despite these findings, challenges to data collection and limitations to this research still remain. First, a 25 sq. km hexagonal grid cell approach was used. However, this approach could not take into consideration neighboring pixel values in the rasters from which the features were drawn. It may be deduced that if an attack occurred in an area deemed agricultural, but on the edge of the pixel nearest urban areas, the attack location was not chosen due to its agricultural nature but its proximity to urban centers. Attempts to include this spatial attribute using interpolation methods degraded model performances. To ensure this limitation was not detrimental, multiple experiments were conducted at different grid-cell sizes (100 and 50 square kilometers), shapes (square), and random sampling. Across all experiments, results differed marginally. The method proposed in this study produced the highest results, though relative model performance remained consistent across all experiments with Random Forest outperforming every other model.\u00a0 Additional Caveats Despite this study's strong findings, readers should understand the limitations of results derived from a systematic point sampling. There are many areas in Europe that are quite obviously not at risk of being attacked (such as rural areas), and few would suggest that they are vulnerable now or in the near future. These unlikely areas (mostly rural and peripheral) were identified by the model potentially inflating the 99% accuracy reported as compared to isolating more challenging areas (rural and separatist attack characteristics) at finer resolutions. The systematic sampling was chosen to eliminate the possibility of selection and\/or sampling bias, but readers should nonetheless be aware of such shortcomings. Future research may improve upon this by introducing deep learning techniques such as key point detection, applying kernels to the entirety of an area, but isolating the specific attack location. This approach would have the added benefit of considering the spatial relationship of nearby pixels in predictions. The features collected for this data contained only a snapshot of the time period covered. For example, it is not believed a terrorist attack in 1970 could have foreseen the land use of Europe in 2020, and it is unlikely the classification would have remained across the fifty years. Greater control over the spatial-temporal aspect of terrorism should be a consideration of future research. From this work, we can conclude the following: Terrorist target selection is not complex and can largely be inferred. Additionally, non-separatist terrorism operates with like-spatial logic but is distinct from that of separatists. Parsing the spatial dimension of territorial terrorism will likely require a unique set of explanatory variables and model selection that is not captured here. Lastly, this study has found the coefficient of variation of nighttime lights to have strong impacts on the level of terrorism, a unique finding not previously determined in past literature. Final model predictions. Please note, each red dot represents a 5-km grid cell that has been enlarged for visualization purposes and is therefore not to scale.  Visual Summary Major finding: separatist terrorists operate with diverging spatial logic compared to their non-separatist counterparts. However, no matter the subtype of non-separatists (left\/right-wing, environmental, etc.), they all appear to operate with similar spatial logic.

Source: \n original work  Looking Ahead The results from this study suggest the spatial dispersion of terrorism in Europe today will likely hold for the foreseeable future, with geopolitical conflicts stemming from separatist sentiments being the most likely cause for disrupting the status quo. Therefore, such movements should be watched closely.\nTo date, the growing body of successful literature on applying machine learning techniques to the prediction of terrorism suggests the application of such models in real-world settings has a promising outlook. However, more work should be done to validate the empirical results reported thus far with respect to practical applicability, especially separatist terrorism.  Things To Watch Could Convolutional Neural Networks and Keypoint Detection techniques provide better predictive capabilities at finer resolutions? What alternative variables could be used to assess the temporal risk of terrorism outside of those used in this study?

These projects will all be costly and time intensive. Railway re-connection would allow the Korean peninsula to be integrated into a rail network spanning the Eurasian continent through China and Russia. Nonetheless, a long and significant modernization process will need to take place to fully integrate the systems in a commercially viable way. Activity North and South Korea are moving forward with inter-Korean railway cooperation as a key engine for advancing inter-Korean relations. Should inter-Korean cooperation result in the re-connection of the railways in North and South Korea, the rail networks of the Korean peninsula could then be integrated into a rail network spanning the Eurasian continent through China and Russia. If actualized, this would mark a significant diplomatic and geopolitical accomplishment for the Korean peninsula. Nonetheless, a long and significant modernization process will need to take place to fully integrate the systems in a commercially viable way. Article  Graphs  Inter-Korean railway cooperation in 2018 was initiated by the April 27 Panmunjom Declaration. 1 Signed on April 27, 2018 by South Korean president Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after the first 2018 inter-Korean summit, the Panmunjom Declaration includes an agreement to implement various infrastructure projects outlined by the 2007 October 4 inter-Korean agreement. Inter-Korean exchanges throughout the summer and fall continued to re-affirm joint commitment to railway cooperation. Inter-Korean railway cooperation in 2018 culminated in a December 26 groundbreaking ceremony at the Panmun station on the east side of the Kaesong Industrial Complex. President Moon has also been building on South Korea's longstanding, albeit intermittent, conversations and aspirational cooperation commitments with China and Russia to plan for future integration of their railway networks. The Organization for Cooperation of Railways (OSJD) June 2018 approval of South Korea's membership now allows South Korea to participate in the Trans-China Railway and the Trans-Siberian Railway. However, physical track infrastructure varies greatly, signal systems differ, and clearances for stations are not compatible. Supporting infrastructure such as communication, energy grids, and even emergency response systems also need to be modernized and harmonized. These projects will all be costly and time intensive. Comparing Track Systems While South Korea and China use standard 1,435 mm gauge track, Russia uses a gauge of 1,520 mm.2 The North Korean systems use a range of gauge widths, but 87 percent of its tracks are 1,435 mm.3 Train speeds are slower in North Korea than in South Korea due to irregular maintenance and old technology.4 However, the actual design speeds also differ between the two systems. South Korean tracks range from 70 to 350 kilometer per hour while North Korean tracks have design speeds that range from 40 to 100 kilometer per hour.5 Rail weights also differ. Those in South Korea range from 50 to 60 kilograms per meter while those in North Korea range from 37 to 50 kilograms per meter. Differences in stations also need to be addressed. South Korean railway tracks have platforms that are 500 mm in height and high-level platforms that are 1135 mm in height. North Korean railway tracks have platforms that are 300 mm in height and high-level platforms that are 1200 mm in height. The clearance of railway stations in South Korea is 6,450 mm. The clearance of railway stations in North Korea is 6,000 mm. In order to accommodate South Korean rail cars, North Korea's railways and stations need to extend their clearance by 450 mm. The current Annex to the Basic Agreement addresses the management of issues related to train length (Chapter 2, Article 9) and station clearance (Chapter 4, Article 26). However, it does not include much reference to other architectural and engineering differences between the tracks and gauges of North and South Korean railways. Railway Connections of the Korean Peninsula There are currently seven rail connections between North Korea and China, Russia, and South Korea.6 These connections and facilities vary considerably in size, capabilities, and operational status. For example, on the North Korea-China border, two connection points have large classification yards for assembling and reassembling freight trains. A third point has only a small yard. The four rail crossings between North Korea and China are: the Sino-Korean friendship bridge connecting the rail station, classification yard, and shops in Sinuiju, North Korea with those in Dandong, China; the Chongsu-Shanghekou railroad bridge connecting the rail facilities at Chongsu, North Korea with a rail station in Shanghekou, China; the Manpo-Jian railroad bridge connecting the rail station, classification yards, and shops at Manpo, North Korea with the Jian rail station in China; and the Namyang-Tumen railroad bridge connecting the rail station, classification yard, and shops in Namyang, North Korea with those in Tumen, China. The single crossing between North Korea and Russia is: the North Korean and Russian rail networks meet at the Korean-Russian Friendship Bridge, which connects the rail station, classification yards, and shops at Tumangang, North Korea with those at Khasan, Russia. The two rail crossings between North and South Korea are: the Panmun-Dorasan railroad crossing connecting North Korea's Panmun (Kaesong) rail facility with South Korea's Dorasan rail station; and the Kamho-Jejin railroad crossing from North Korea's Kamho (Nungho) rail facility to the Jejin rail station in South Korea. Located on the border with China in the northwest corner of North Korea's North Pyongan province, the Sinuiju-Dandong railroad crossing connects the North Korean city of Sinuiju to the Chinese city of Dandong. This crossing consists of the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge (42.949050 129.849236) a combination road and rail bridge across the Yalu River, the Dandong railyards, and the Sinuiju railyards. This is the most well-known and important rail crossing between China and North Korea as it serves as the primary railroad crossing for passenger and general freight between the two countries. This crossing is, therefore, a lead indicator of the level of economic activity between the two countries. On the North Korean side of the border the Sinuiju railyards are significantly smaller by comparison encompassing only 0.12 square kilometers and consists of: a freight classification yard with approximately nine tracks; a locomotive and rail car repair and servicing shop; passenger car servicing facility; and covered passenger and freight terminal with approximately four tracks. A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that, like the Dandong railyards, the Sinuiju railyards are active year-round. However, due to the covered passenger and freight terminal, an accurate accounting of the average number of rail cars present is not practical. The large covered terminals at both Dandong and Sinuiju are the only ones located on the China-North Korea border and are useful in masking the number and types of rail cars (and to a certain extent their contents) moving between the two nations. Befitting its importance, the rail line from Sinuiju to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang is one of the best maintained and the most modern in the North Korean railroad network. Taken as a whole, the Dandong railyards encompass approximately 0.44 square kilometers making them the second largest Chinese rail facility on the North Korean border - the largest rail facility is at Tumen, which encompasses 0.9 square kilometers. Among the more significant rail facilities located at Dandong are: freight classification and holding yards with approximately 25 tracks; a secondary holding yard with two tracks; locomotive and rail car repair and servicing shops (many of which are covered); extensive warehouse facilities (many of which are covered) and unloading docks; extensive rail side industrial facilities; and large covered passenger and freight terminal with approximately 16 tracks. A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that the Dandong railyards are very active year-round, as is to be expected for the Chinese city situated on the primary border crossing with North Korea. They may also provide an evidentiary basis to the claim by experts that China has normalized commerce with North Korea after a period of harsh sanctioning in the last quarter of 2017. An accurate accounting of the average number of locomotives and rail cars present, however, is not practical due to a large number of extensive covered rail facilities (e.g., warehouse and terminals). While they are known primarily in South Korea and the U.S. as being the focal point of cross border trade between China and North Korea and an overall indicator of China-North Korea relations, the railyards at Sinuiju and Dandong are primarily designed to serve their respective cities. Both of which have large populations and a variety of industries. In both cases the railyards serve as critical rail facilities in their regions with special capabilities (e.g., locomotive, rail car and passenger car repair and servicing facilities, etc.). For Sinuiju, the only comparable rail servicing facilities in North Pyongan province are found at Chonju, far to the south. While the facilities at Dandong are the largest and most comprehensive in eastern Liaoning province. Regardless of the political-economic conditions in play at any given time, the Sinuiju-Dandong railroad crossing and railyards serve as the primary interchange for trade between the two countries. For North Korea the crossing is critical to its economic and security well-being. The North Korea-China Railroad Crossing at Chongsu-Shanghekou Located on the border with China in North Pyongan province, approximately 58 kilometers northeast of the Dandong-Sinuiju crossing, is the Chongsu-Shanghekou railroad crossing (40.458850 124.879464) over the Yalu River. This is a secondary crossing between the two countries that consists of the bridge that connects the small North Korean city of Chongsu to the Chinese town of Shanghekou, rail facilities at Chongsu, and a rail station at Shanghekou. Approximately 950 meters east of the Chongsu-Shanghekou Rail Bridge is the Chongsu railyard (40.459327 124.890642) that encompass approximately 0.1 square kilometers. The railyard contains a small passenger station with four tracks - two of which are used for freight and coal sorting and storage. In the past there was sizeable locomotive servicing and repair facility here; however, this has been abandoned, and the track was removed prior to 2006. All that remains are the foundation of a turntable, roundhouse, thermal plant, and several support buildings. A refurbishing of these structures, therefore, would be a lead indicator of expanded cooperation in the future. Located approximately 3.5 kilometers southwest of the bridge is the small rail station at Shanghekou (40.437281 124.850714). This is a minor facility encompassing approximately 0.01 square kilometers consisting of a passenger station with a mainline and passing track and no railyard or servicing facilities. A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2017-2018 shows essentially no rail traffic at the Shanghekou rail station and only minor traffic in the Chongsu railyard. This suggests that there is no significant rail traffic at this crossing between the two countries at this time. The minor rail traffic seen at the Chongsu rail facility is likely in support of the city of Chongsu. Such traffic may increase if the reported construction of a nuclear-grade graphite production plant in the city proves to be correct. The Chongsu-Shanghekou railroad crossing is a secondary point of interchange between North Korea and China. The small rail station at Shanghekou and the declining facilities at Chongsu strongly suggest that they do not presently contribute significantly to either nations rail network economy. Due to this crossings remote location, it is likely that even if economic cooperation between China and North Korea increases this crossing will remain of secondary importance. The North Korea-China Railroad Crossing at Manpo-Jian Located on the border with China, approximately 35 kilometers northwest of the Kanggye, is the Manpo-Jian railroad crossing (41.155090 126.273282) in Chagang province. This crossing consists of both the Manpo-Jian railroad bridge and, 1.2 kilometers to the northeast, the Manpo-Jian road bridge. Both bridges connect the small North Korean city of Manpo to the much larger Chinese city of Jian. On the North Korean side of the border, the Manpo railyard is located 750 meters southeast of the rail bridge and encompasses 0.14 square kilometers - making it physically the largest North Korean rail facility on the Chinese border. The facility consists of: a freight classification yard with approximately four tracks; a passenger terminal with four tracks; two storage\/holding yards - one with four tracks (tank cars) and the other with six tracks (passenger and freight cars); and large locomotive and rail car repair and servicing shops consisting of a repair building, roundhouse, turntable, thermal plant, and several support buildings. A preliminary review of satellite imagery shows that the Manpo rail facility is relatively active year-round with approximately 90-125 locomotives and rail cars of various types present at any given time; however, a number of these in the holding yards appear to be in storage or retired in place as they haven't moved in years. Located on the Chinese side of the border, 6.8 kilometers west of the railroad bridge, is the small Jian rail station. The station encompasses approximately 0.1 square kilometers and consists of: a passenger station and small freight classification yard with seven tracks; and several freight warehouses and unloading docks. The Jian rail station has no significant rail servicing or repair facilities. A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that the Jian passenger station and small freight classification yard are active year-round, as is to be expected for a small Chinese city, with an average 10-25 locomotives and rail cars of various types present at any given time. While considered a secondary crossing, the Manpo-Jian railroad crossing appears to be an important rail and road connection between China and the North Korean industrial cities of Kanggye and Pyorha-ri, and Chonchonall of which are involved in military-related production. Therefore, this connection, and the volume of traffic through it, could be considered a lead indicator of an upturn in China-North Korea commerce. The North Korea-China Railroad Crossing at Namyang-Tumen Located on the border with China, in the furthest northeast corner of North Korea, is the Namyang-Tumen railroad crossing (42.949050 129.849236) in North Hamgyong province. This crossing consists of both the Tumen railroad bridge (Tumen-gyo) and, 600 meters to the northeast, the Tumen road bridge (Tumen-taegyo). Additionally, a new larger road bridge has been under construction since 2016. The bridges connect the small North Korean city of Namyang to the much larger Chinese city of Tumen. On the North Korean side of the border, the Namyang railyard is both tiny and rudimentary by comparison encompassing only 0.12 square kilometers and consists of: a freight classification yard with approximately nine tracks; small rudimentary locomotive and rail car repair and servicing shop; one small coal storage yard; a passenger terminal; and a passenger car servicing facility. A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that although small the Namyang rail facility is relatively active year-round with an average of 42 locomotives and rail cars of various types present. As with the Tumen rail facilities, over 90 percent of these are ore carrying cars. Taken as a whole, the Tumen railyards encompass approximately 0.9 square kilometers making them the largest Chinese rail facility on the North Korean border. In comparison, the second largest rail facility is at Dandong and encompass only 0.4 square kilometers. Among the more significant rail facilities at Tumen are:7 a freight classification yard with approximately 20 tracks; extensive locomotive and rail car repair and servicing shops; an intermodal yard (rail-to-truck); eight coal storage yards (two of which are for power generation); two passenger terminals; a passenger car servicing facility; and numerous freight warehouses and unloading docks. A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that the Tumen railyards are very active year-round as is to be expected for a Chinese city situated on an important border crossing with an average in excess of 500 locomotives and rail cars of various types present; however, over 90 percent are ore carrying cars. The Tumen railyards are primarily designed to serve Tumen city and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in general. The railyards consist of a wide range of facilities (e.g., locomotive and rail car repair and servicing shops, passenger car repair and servicing facilities, intermodal yard, etc.) that compliment rather than supplant those found in nearby Yanbian, Hunchun and Wangqing. To a significantly lesser degree, and under favorable political-economic conditions, the Tumen railyards serve as an important railroad interchange for trade with North Korea. The proximity of the Namyang-Tumen crossing to the ore mines in North Hamgyong province and the presence of seven coal yards among the Tumen rail facilities are notable and suggest that this is one of the primary land routes for the export of coal from North Korea to China. Therefore, it is a lead indicator of the volume of bilateral business between the two in extractive industries. In addition, should overall economic cooperation between China and North Korea increase, it is logical that the Tumen railyards will be the primary port of entry for goods moving between the Rason Special Economic Zone (specifically the port of Rason [Najin] 88 kilometers to the south). Despite considerable Chinese investment in Rason in the past, a preliminary examination using satellite imagery of rail activity and shipping movements at the port during 2018 does not indicate any significant activity that would suggest significant Chinese use of the port. The construction of a new road bridge that began in 2016 is an additional indicator of the importance of the Namyang-Tumen railroad crossing to both countries. The North Korea-Russia Railroad Crossing at Tumangang-Khasan Located on the border with Russia, in the northeast corner of the country on the Tumen River, is the Tumangang-Khasan railroad crossing (42.415397 130.641489), in North Hamgyong province. The crossing consists of the Korean-Russian Friendship Bridge, Tumangang railyard and Khasan railyard. This is North Koreas sole railroad crossing with Russia and is of great potential importance due to its proximity to the port city of Rason (Najin) in the Rason Special Economic Zone, 33.5 km to the southeast. Although a railroad bridge across the Tumen River has been at this location since the colonial days, the current Korean-Russian Friendship Bridge replaced that bridge in 1959. The Tumangang railyard (42.417307 130.618461) encompasses approximately 2.5 square kilometers making it the nations largest rail facility connecting to any country. It serves as the gateway for all rail shipped goods between North Korea and Russia, but more importantly is the point where goods are transferred from Russian-gauged rail cars to Korean-gauged rail cars. Among the more significant rail facilities located here are: two large classification and storage yards with approximately 10 tracks and 8 tracks respectively; locomotive, rail, and passenger car repair and servicing shops; a passenger terminal; numerous freight warehouses, unloading docks, open-storage areas, and rail-side industries; and a dispersed, but sizable, petroleum products storage facility with approximately 33 storage tanks.8 A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that the Tumangang facilities are active year-round as is to be expected for a railyard situated on both the major rail line serving the northeast corner of the nation and an important border crossing. Approximately 45-80 locomotives and rail cars of various types are present at any given time. Of these, 40-50 percent are tank cars suggesting that the petroleum products storage facility is a major source of rail traffic. Therefore, this railway node is probably the most transparent lead indicator of Russian energy assistance to North Korea. It is unclear, however, how much of the rail traffic at the Tumangang railyard is related to trade with Russia. Encompassing 1.2 square kilometers, the Khasan railyard (42.430654 130.645571) is physically the largest along any border with North Korea. Much of it, however, is either open land or abandoned. About the only facilities currently operational here are: a freight classification yard with approximately nine tracks; a passenger terminal; and some small support buildings. A preliminary review of satellite imagery during 2018 shows that the Khasan rail facility is active year-round, however, there are wide swings in the number of locomotives and rail cars of various types present. These swings can vary from just 2 to over 200. When larger numbers are present over 95 percent are ore (most likely coal) carrying cars. The proximity of the Tumangang rail facility to the large coal mines in North Hamgyong province and the presence of large numbers of coal cars in the Khasan rail facility are notable and indicate that this activity is related to the Russian importing of coal from North Korea. Should economic cooperation between Russia and North Korea increase, it is logical that this trade will increase, and the Tumangang rail facility will expand into the primary port of entry for goods moving between the two countries. Russian goods could eventually be exported from the Rason Special Economic Zone (specifically the port of Rason [Najin]) and, if the rail connections are made, to the South Korean ports of Pohang and Busan.

Further upgrades would expand operational capacity towards the GIUK-N Gap. However, GEOINT analysis shows slow construction progress.  Severomorsk-1 can deepen Russia's strategic reach and propel its forward line of defense further from its coastline, enhancing anti-access\/aerial denial capabilities near and around the Kola Peninsula. Activity GEOINT analysis shows mostly slow construction and modernization progress at Severomorsk-1 Air base. Article  Timeline  Graphs  Introduction Russia's western Arctic houses a concentration of advanced conventional capabilities for defensive and potentially offensive purposes centered on the Kola Peninsula and home to its Northern Fleet headquarters, which hosts Russia's most advanced Arctic land, air, and naval assets notably its nuclear arsenal and second-strike capabilities. The Peninsula's location a gateway between the Arctic and the North Atlantic and its extensive military assets make it central to Russia's homeland defense and power projection capabilities. Russian military modernization efforts and new construction on the Kola Peninsula have centered around the refurbishment of air bases and expansion of naval bases. everomorsk-1 Air Base, Gadzhiyevo Submarine Base, and Okolnaya Submarine Support Base are particularly important due to their expansion and added depth to Russia's defenses while ensuring Russia's freedom of navigation and air sovereignty. Neighboring sites, such as the Plesetsk Cosmodrome located at the Kura Missile Test Range in Arkhangelsk, enhance Russia's Arctic military capabilities as the recent Grom-2019 exercise demonstrated. The Plesetsk Cosmodrome is a particularly noteworthy site for testing advanced weapons like the RS-24 Yars ICBM. Military exercises and weapons testing in and around the Kola Peninsula are frequent and reveal Russia's operational readiness to engage its nuclear forces in potential conflict to deter adversaries. Exercises such as Ocean Shield and Grom-2019 also demonstrate Russia's calculation that the Arctic is a critical domain to its national security, power project capabilities, and economic interests. It is assessed that Russia's modernization and expansion efforts will continue on and around the Kola Peninsula well into the future with the ultimate aim of asserting Russian sovereignty across the region. Modernization of Severomorsk-1 Air Base Located on the southern outskirts of Severomorsk and approximately 15.5 kilometers northeast of Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula (Murmanskaya Oblast) is the Severomorsk-1 Air Base. Severomorsk-1 dates to World War II when it was known simply as Severomorsk Air Base which protected the Soviet Union's northern flank and provided air protection for both navy facilities on the Kola Peninsula and allied supply convoys destined for the port of Murmansk.1 During the Cold War, Severomorsk-1's strategic importance increased, along with that of its two sister air bases Severomorsk-2 and Severomorsk-3. Strategic bombers (e.g., Tu-16\/-95), strike (e.g., Su-24) and patrol aircraft (e.g., Il-38) based or staged were tasked with protecting the Soviet Unions northwestern Arctic flank and providing strategic strike capability against the United States. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the serviceability and capabilities of the Severomorsk air bases declined precipitously. The strategic importance of Severomorsk-1 reemerged however during late-2011 or early 2012. During that time the Russian military began an extensive multi-year modernization project of the base,2 which was in advance of the Russian Defense Ministry's 2013 announcement that it was reengaging in the Arctic to guard its northern approaches, protect mineral and energy resources, and monitor shipping on the Northern Sea Route.3 Since 2014, the Air Base falls under the command of the Northern Fleet.4 Satellite imagery of the Severomorsk-1 Air Base (69.030776 N, 33.42271 E) from May 14, 2012 shows that the base ceased to be operational as the modernization project was underway. Noticeable developments include: The concrete on the main runway and taxiways has been removed and the sub-surface was being graded All operational aircraft had been moved to other air bases (likely Severomorsk-3) The remaining non-operational retired aircraft awaiting parts recovery and scrapping have been concentrated along the southwest side of the base in abandoned revetments with 18 aircraft visible The helicopter servicing and storage facility (also used for parts removal and scrapping) in the southwest corner remained operational with at least 67 helicopters of several types and in various states of repair. (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, May 14, 2012) (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, May 14, 2012) (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, May 14, 2012) (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, May 14, 2012) Five years later, on July 30, 2017, satellite imagery shows that considerable -- albeit very slow progress was made: While the base was still not operational, the paving of the 3,500-meter-long runway appears to have been finished Several new taxiways were under construction The revetments and parking aprons for operational aircraft, at the north end of the runway had been completed The infrastructure for the instrument landing system (ILS) was under construction The 18 retired aircraft awaiting parts recovery and scrapping that were previously in abandoned revetments on the southwest perimeter had been repositioned to an unimproved taxiway in the center of the air base The number of helicopters at the helicopter servicing and storage facility declined to approximately 53 of several types and in various states of repair Many of the previously abandoned aircraft revetments have been razed (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, July 30, 2017) (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, July 30, 2017) (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, July 30, 2017) (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, July 30, 2017) (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, July 30, 2017) More recently, a September 4, 2019 satellite image, shows that while the air base had once again become operational, the modernization project was not complete as much of the work on some infrastructure (e.g., completion of taxiways and aprons) remained to be completed. Among the indications that the base had become operational were: Patrol and transport aircraft and helicopters are deployed on aprons and in revetments at the north end of the runway The presence of a transport aircraft on a taxiway leading to the runway Tire tracks from landings are visible on either end of the runway The taxiways and aprons continue to be slowly expanded The number of helicopters at the helicopter servicing and storage facility continued to decline with approximately 36 of several types and in various states of repair being present Only 12 of the approximately 18 retired aircraft awaiting parts recovery and scrapping remain. Several of which show recent signs (e.g., wings sections laying on the ground, etc.) of being disassembled (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, September 4, 2019) (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, September 4, 2019) (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, September 4, 2019) (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, September 4, 2019) (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, September 4, 2019) (Severomorsk-1 Air Base, September 4, 2019) Throughout this modernization, minor improvements have been undertaken among the air bases supporting infrastructure including housing, warehouse, machines shops and support areas on the north side of the base. However, the modern Murmansk-BN electronic warfare system, which had been reported as being deployed in the Severomorsk area, was not readily identified in the area immediately around the Severomorsk-1 Air Base in the most recent satellite image.5 Given the relatively slow pace of construction observed during the past eight years, it is unclear when the entire modernization project will finally be complete. Analysis Upgrades to Severomorsk-1 Air base increases Russian operational readiness, presence, and capabilities in the northwest Arctic region. Construction suggest the Air base will primarily support patrol and search-and-rescue aircraft. This will improve domain awareness and operational capacity around the Kola Peninsula. Increased numbers of patrol aircraft tasked for search-and-rescue operations improve the viability of the NSR as a maritime commercial route. With further upgrades to the base, operational capacity could expand further into the Barents Sea, Greenland Sea, North Atlantic, and an increasingly ice free Arctic Ocean. In anticipation of receding ice and increased human activity in the far north, Severomorsk-1 can deepen Russia's strategic reach and propel its forward line of defense further from its coastline, enhancing anti-access\/aerial denial capabilities near the Kola Peninsula.

{"article":"Tracking the Relocation of Rohingya Refugees in Bangladesh_ A Nighttime Lighting Approach.json","text":"Human Rights  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Tracking the Relocation of Rohingya Refugees in Bangladesh: A Nighttime Lighting Approach  In partnership with \n RAND \n and written by \n Eric Robinson, \n Maggie Habib, \n Sean Mann, \n and Ed Burke  Latest 18920 Rohingya refugees on Bhasan Char (May 2021) Impact nightlights used to track refugee flows Published Jan 13 2022 12\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  This report uses nighttime lighting data to track the relocation of Rohingya refugees from the Cox's Bazaar region of Bangladesh to Bhasan Char, a 'floating island' in the Bay of Bengal built by the Government of Bangladesh to house roughly 100,000 refugees. Constructed on reclaimed land in a monsoon, cyclone, and tsunami-prone region, Bhasan Char poses not only humanitarian challenges, but physical and human rights challenges as the Rohingya become isolated from the mainland. This report demonstrates how nighttime lighting data serves as a useful independent measure of the Government of Bangladesh's efforts to relocate Rohingya refugees onto the island over time, which could prove beneficial to those involved in humanitarian and disaster resilience and response planning over the coming months and years.  Activity GEOINT analysis of nighttime lighting and other open data sources shows that refugee facilities in Cox's Bazaar continue to grow despite efforts to transfer more refugees to newly constructed facilities on Bhasan Char. Independent nighttime lighting analysis affirms public estimates of the refugee population on Bhasan Char at around 19,000 and reveals that semi-isolated housing plots on the island may be housing at-risk minority populations within the Rohingya based on previous safety concerns at Cox's Bazaar.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  The Rohingya people are a stateless Muslim minority group that have historically resided in the northern Rakhine state in Burma (Myanmar), along the Bay of Bengal in the northeastern Indian Ocean. They have suffered frequent persecution at the hands of Burmese government forces over the last several decades, spurring periodic waves of Rohingya refugee flows across the border into the Cox's Bazaar region of neighboring Bangladesh. Two prior waves of persecution in the late 20th century forced hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees into refugee camps in Cox's Bazaar district in 1978 and 1991-1992. In the years that followed, the vast majority of these refugees returned to Burma under a series of repatriation agreements between Bangladesh and Burma. A third major wave of violence in 2016 forced roughly 87,000 Rohingya refugees into the Ukiya Upazila portion of Cox's Bazaar, where many still reside to this day. By 2017, before the start of the most recent Rohingya crisis later that year, roughly 200,000 Rohingya refugees already resided in refugee camps in Bangladesh. Figure One. Key Locations in Burma and Bangladesh Source: \u201cWhat next for Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya?,\u201d The Economist, August 2nd, 2018. As of December 2021: https:\/\/www.economist.com\/open-future\/2018\/08\/02\/what-next-for-myanmars-rohingya  In August 2017, Burmese government forces began a new wave of extreme violence against the Rohingya throughout northern Rakhine state, committing atrocities against local villagers in what the United States has since deemed a campaign of ethnic cleansing. These events initiated the largest migration of Rohingya refugees to date, forcing approximately 725,000 people to flee Rakhine state across the border into Bangladesh. The majority of these refugees, roughly 670,000, arrived at Cox's Bazaar in September 2017, with the remainder arriving over the next three months. Many of these individuals settled into the vicinity of former refugee camps that had been built to serve previous displaced Rohingya populations in the 1990s. By October 2017, the Government of Bangladesh moved to construct new facilities to house roughly 100,000 Rohingya refugees on Bhasan Char, an island made from reclaimed land in the middle of the Bay of Bengal, activating a plan that had first been proposed in 2015. These efforts drew prompt condemnation from the international community and Rohingya populations as well for the geographic isolation of Bhasan Char in the middle of the Bay of Bengal, as well as the fact that the island lies just a few feet above sea level in a monsoon-prone region. One refugee would later describe Bhasan Char as \"an island jail in the middle of the sea.\" Despite these concerns, construction on Bhasan Char would surge throughout 2018, with plans to begin resettling Rohingya refugees from Cox's Bazaar to the island later that year. Ultimately, it would take until January 2020 for the Government of Bangladesh to declare Bhasan Char ready for habitation. By May 2020, the first Rohingya refugees were resettled into facilities on Bhasan Char after they were first barred entry into Malaysia at sea, and rescued by Bangladesh's Coast Guard. Subsequently, the first large-scale refugee transfers to Bhasan Char occurred in December 2020, when 3,400 Rohingya were relocated from Cox's Bazaar onto the island. Initial reports suggested that Rohingya Christians were the first to be relocated, in part because these and other minority groups within the broader refugee population had faced frequent threats of violence, including kidnappings, within the crowded camps of Cox's Bazaar. By October 2021, the Government of Bangladesh reported that only 19,000 Rohingya refugees had been relocated to the island in total, less than 20 percent of its overall capacity. That same month, the Government of Bangladesh announced a new agreement with the United Nations to work together to provide services and support to Rohingya refugees on Bhasan Char, with plans to move an additional 81,000 refugees to the island throughout early 2022. Despite human rights concerns, this agreement reportedly did not guarantee the ability of Rohingya refugees to move freely between Bhasan Char and mainland Bangladesh. Bangladesh's continued transfer of refugees onto Bhasan Char also poses challenges for the international community as it continues to provide support to vulnerable Rohingya refugees throughout Bangladesh. Continued aid will increasingly need to be split between disparate locations in Cox's Bazaar and Bhasan Char, which are roughly 150 kilometers apart by sea. Beyond these logistical challenges, future catastrophic weather events impacting Bhasan Char could require a large-scale civilian evacuation or disaster response effort that likely exceeds the capacity of the Government of Bangladesh. As such, the rate of transfer of refugees to Bhasan Char is a critical factor for international humanitarian organizations, government agencies, and even military planners who are likely to play a role in future disaster response efforts. Methodology and Data In the past, RAND researchers have used nighttime lighting data to track changes in levels of activity at key infrastructure in remote or denied parts of the world, often where other sources of data are unavailable to provide reliable insights. In Iraq and Syria, RAND used nighttime lighting data to understand changes in economic activity in cities taken over by the Islamic State. In western China, RAND has used nighttime lighting data to track China's efforts to reeducate and imprison its Uyghur and other ethnic Muslim minority populations in rural Xinjiang Province. In this report, we use nighttime lighting data to track the relocation of Rohingya refugees from Cox's Bazaar to Bhasan Char. This approach allows us to measure changes in the intensity of activity at refugee camps that may not be visible in overhead imagery. As in past research, we calculate nighttime lighting estimates over specific locations using monthly cloud-free composite raster images from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day\/Night Band, made available via the Earth Observation Group at the Colorado School of Mines. To assess nighttime lighting trends over specific refugee camps in both Cox's Bazaar and Bhasan Char, we first reproject each composite nighttime lighting image from its original resolution (15 arc-seconds, or approximately 350 meters at 40-degrees latitude) to a finer-scale 30-meter resolution using simple linear interpolation. This improves our ability to accurately measure nighttime lighting for smaller refugee camps and helps to reduce potential bias from adjacent infrastructure. Then, we produce monthly trendlines over each refugee camp that represent the raw nighttime lighting value from the NOAA VIIRS sensor averaged over each facility. We then normalize these measurements over each camp to their nighttime lighting value in February 2018, improving our ability to make meaningful comparisons of the relative growth of specific locations over time and across similar locations with differing baseline levels of electrification. In prior research, we have adjusted these normalized raw values using moving averages to smooth out month-to-month variation in the relatively noisy VIIRS data. In this case, however, given the relatively small size of each refugee camp and their close proximity to adjacent camps, we choose not to artificially smooth these values to avoid potential bias in our interpretation. The resulting dataset produces a noisy yet informative assessment of the timeliness of periods of major construction and electrification at key refugee camps in both Cox's Bazaar and Bhasan Char. The next section reviews these findings, examining trends in the growth of facilities in each location and eventually estimating the size of the refugee population on Bhasan Char as of May 2021, the last date for which we have composite nighttime lighting data.1 Nighttime Lighting over Cox's Bazaar Cox's Bazaar is a district in the larger Chittagong Division of Bangladesh, comprising the southernmost portion of mainland Bangladesh along the Bay of Bengal. Existing geospatial data charting the location of major Rohingya refugee camps show eight primary groups of camps of varying sizes, plotted below in Figure Two. Figure Two.

As of December 2021: https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/news\/picture\/rohingya-repatriation-process-stalls-idUSRTS269LK.  The two largest camps in Cox's Bazaar are in northern Ukhia Upazila (number one in the map above), as well as southern Teknaf Upazila (number eight in the map above). These camps largely consist of sprawling, temporary structures that are loosely organized yet compactly built into the surrounding landscape. For context, Figure Two above also shows an image from November 2018, taken inside the Balukhali portion of the larger Kutapalong Refugee Camp in Ukhia Upazila. This image also shows the types of nighttime lighting likely to be captured by NOAA's satellite sensor, with solar-powered lamps inside the refugee camp lit up at night. Figure Three below plots the average monthly nighttime lighting estimates over these two largest camps in Cox's Bazaar, the Kutapalong Refugee Camp in Ukhia Upazila (in blue), and the southernmost camp in Teknaf Upazila (in red). Given the temporary nature of most buildings in these camps, and the relative poverty of those refugees living in them, increased nighttime lighting over these facilities is likely to be a product of efforts by the Government of Bangladesh and the international community to build more permanent or resilient structures within these facilities, accompanied by solar or other sources of power.

These nighttime lighting estimates reveal several initial insights. First, despite the settlement of roughly 87,000 refugees into Ukhia Upazila throughout 2016, there were only marginal increases in nighttime lighting over the course of that same year. Similarly, nighttime lighting over both camps increased at a relatively modest pace in the months following the onset of violence against the Rohingya in late 2017. Major increases in nighttime lighting following these refugee flows, particularly in Ukhia Upazila, did not come until two periods in mid-to-late 2018 as well as throughout 2020 and early 2021. As such, we assess that these increases are likely the product of increased efforts to electrify certain portions of these camps, rather than major inflows of refugees. Finally, and perhaps of most relevance to our efforts to track the relocation of Rohingya to Bhasan Char, this data reveals that nighttime lighting over Cox's Bazaar's two largest camps has actually continued to expand in recent years despite the increasing relocation of refugees out of these camps. This suggests either that refugee relocations have been marginal in scale so far, or just as likely, that efforts to electrify portions of Cox's Bazaar have continued (and are likely to continue) despite these relocations. This is logical to the extent that Bhasan Char's capacity is estimated to be around 100,000 refugees, just a fraction of the nearly one million Rohingya refugees currently living in Cox's Bazaar. Nighttime Lighting over Bhasan Char Unlike the ad-hoc camps of Cox's Bazaar, facilities on Bhasan Char were purpose-built by the Government of Bangladesh to house refugees on reclaimed, largely flat land. As a result, Bhasan Char's housing facilities were constructed across roughly 120 nearly identical housing plots arrayed across the island in a grid-like fashion, each containing twelve separate buildings and a storm shelter. Figure Four below shows the distribution of these plots across the island, as well as an image taken from the island showing the types of buildings constructed. Figure Four.

As of December 2021: https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/asia-pacific\/un-deal-offers-no-guarantees-free-movement-rohingya-island-leaked-copy-2021-10-15\/.  In previous research focused on Uyghur detention efforts in western China, RAND assessed through overhead satellite imagery that major spikes in nighttime lighting over key infrastructure were often correlated with periods of active construction of new buildings, particularly in areas without major preexisting infrastructure. Figure Five below plots the average nighttime over Bhasan Char since 2014, revealing similar trends. Figure Five. Nighttime Lighting over Bhasan Char Note: This figure plots average monthly nighttime lighting over all of Bhasan Char, normalized to its value in February 2018.  These results suggest that the most elevated periods of nighttime lighting seen on the island occurred during a series of major spikes during the summer of 2018. This closely aligns with official statements from the Government of Bangladesh during that time period, which prematurely suggested that construction on the island would soon be finished. Later spikes in nighttime lighting would similarly occur in early 2020 and early 2021. These two time periods correlate well with other points on our timeline - including efforts by the Government of Bangladesh to finalize the island for habitation in 2020, and the early relocation of refugees from Cox's Bazaar beginning that same year and through 2021. At least anecdotally, these results suggest that nighttime lighting may serve as a useful proxy for tracking the relocation of Rohingya refugees onto Bhasan Char over time. And yet, given the unique structure and layout of the facilities constructed on Bhasan Char, we can extend our methodology to attempt a more precise estimate of the number of Rohingya relocated to the island throughout 2021. Figure Six below provides a more detailed view of these facilities. Figure Six. Bhasan Char Refugee Housing in Detail Source: (Left) Google Earth, 2018.

As of December 2021: https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/01431161.2017.1342050  Across the island, 120 separate plots of land are arrayed in a grid-like fashion. Open source estimates suggest that each plot contains 12 single-story buildings, each meant to house 16 families of four individuals, along with one larger storm shelter that houses 23 families. Each building's roof also contains solar panels to provide electricity. Altogether, this suggests that each plot can house up to 860 refugees, for a total of 103,200 individuals at maximum capacity across Bhasan Char's 120 separate plots. With these numbers in mind, we can then use plot-specific changes in nighttime lighting within Bhasan Char to assess whether certain locations on the island have experienced more growth than others, and use these locations to estimate a more precise total population of refugees currently living on Bhasan Char. As discussed earlier in this report, the major periods of construction on Bhasan Char occurred in 2018 and 2020, with initial refugee relocations onto the island reportedly beginning in 2020 throughout 2021. As a result, we focus on isolating those locations on the island which experienced outsized growth in nighttime lighting in the most recent months of our dataset (throughout 2021) relative to their average nighttime lighting in 2019, thereby avoiding potential bias from periods of construction in preceding and intervening years. Figure Seven below shows all 120 housing plots of Bhasan Char, categorized by the level of growth in nighttime lighting over each housing plot as measured in 2021 compared to 2019. We break down this growth into four categories. First, we assess that 22 housing plots experienced major growth in nighttime lighting in 2021 (through May 2021, our data cutoff), defined as having greater than 65 percent growth between the maximum monthly nighttime lighting in 2021 relative to average monthly nighttime lighting across all of 2019. Second, we assess that 37 housing plots experienced moderate growth, defined as having between 45 and 65 percent growth between these years. Third, we assess that 32 housing plots experienced modest growth of between 25 and 45 percent. And finally, we assess that 29 housing plots experienced only marginal growth or even declines in nighttime lighting, defined as less than 25 percent growth between 2019 and 2021. Cut-points between each category of nighttime lighting growth were determined by identifying substantive breaks in the distribution of growth across all 120 plots. Figure Seven. Nighttime Lighting Growth in 2021 on Bhasan Char, by Housing Plot Note: Major growth is defined as a plot experiencing 65 percent or more growth in monthly nighttime lighting at its peak in 2021 compared to its average monthly nighttime lighting in 2019. Moderate growth is defined as experiencing between 45 and 65 percent. Modest growth is defined as experiencing between 25 and 45 percent. Marginal growth is defined as experiencing less than 25 percent growth. Source: RAND Nighttime Lighting Analysis, NOAA VIIRS, and Google Earth Pro, 2018.  Several insights emerge from these results. First, major nighttime lighting growth in 2021 appears to have occurred in housing plots primarily along the southwest corner of the island, closest to the maritime port of entry for refugees arriving from the mainland, as well as the primary set of administrative and logistical buildings on Bhasan Char located on the western side of the island. These results are logical to the extent that the first tranche of relocated refugees would be housed closest to the infrastructure required to support their presence, rather than the far end of the island. Alternatively, elevated nighttime lighting over these housing plots could also be the product of adjacency effects resulting from nighttime lighting over this infrastructure spilling over into the measurements for those nearby housing plots. And yet, a second key insight would suggest that these effects are indeed the result of relocated refugees moving into these housing plots and not just adjacency effects. Specifically, we see major nighttime lighting growth in early 2021 in a more isolated set of eight housing plots in the southernmost portion of Bhasan Char, as seen near the bottom of Figure Seven. These plots are isolated from the main body of refugee housing plots by a set of trees and connected only by one road. Recall from our earlier discussion that initial reports suggested that initial priority was given to transferring vulnerable minorities within the Rohingya population onto the island in 2020 and 2021, in part to minimize the risks of violence they faced within the crowded camps on the mainland. The growth in nighttime lighting seen in this isolated set of housing plots is consistent with a potentially deliberate effort to house these vulnerable populations in separate, more isolated facilities on the island. Using these four categories of nighttime lighting in housing plots across Bhasan Char (major, moderate, modest, marginal), we can now attempt to estimate the population of Rohingya refugees likely already resettled on Bhasan Char as of May 2021, the most recent month in which our nighttime lighting data are available. Based upon the estimated 860-person capacity of each individual housing plot, and our finding that only 22 housing plots experienced major nighttime lighting growth through early 2021, we assess the likely minimum population of Rohingya refugees on the island as of May 2021 was roughly 18,920. This correlates almost precisely with the public estimate of 19,000 refugees offered by the Government of Bangladesh later that same year. Our estimates are summarized below in Table One. Table One. Estimating the Refugee Population Resettled on Bhasan Char, 2021 Note: Estimated population is based upon nighttime lighting growth trajectory of individual plots on Bhasan Char, using NOAA VIIRS data through May 2021 Source: RAND Nighttime Lighting Analysis, NOAA VIIRS, and Mukta Dinwiddie MacLaren Architects, Atlanta Housing Ltd, UNOCHA, Reuters. As of December 2021: https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/01431161.2017.1342050  Of note, we cannot assess with precision using nighttime lighting whether each of the 22 housing plots experiencing major nighttime lighting growth through May 2021 were housed to full capacity within each individual plot at that point in time. And yet, these findings suggest that nighttime lighting growth on Bhasan Char may be a closely lagging or even leading indicator of eventual inhabitation of specific housing plots by relocated refugees. Given that the island is primarily run on solar power and diesel generation, it is logical that such power would be prioritized to those areas with refugees present or soon to arrive, and not to those housing plots which remain empty - particularly at night. To that extent, it is worth noting that the additional 37 housing plots that experienced moderate nighttime lighting growth through May 2021 have a combined capacity to house an additional 31,820 refugees, primarily in the center of the island. Similarly, 32 housing plots that experienced more modest nighttime lighting growth in early 2021 have a combined capacity to house an additional 27,520 refugees. It is certainly possible that some percentage of these housing plots are either currently inhabited, or likely soon to be inhabited by relocated Rohingya refugees. Either way, this analysis suggests that nighttime lighting growth will serve as a useful signal of the rate with which the Government of Bangladesh continues to relocate Rohingya refugees onto the island throughout 2022. Given the need to provide humanitarian support to these populations, human rights concerns over their ability to transit back and forth between Bhasan Char and mainland Bangladesh, and the potential for catastrophic weather events over Bhasan Char to require a complex evacuation or disaster response from the international community, close tracking of the population on the island may prove essential in the coming months and years. Key Takeaways Key findings and implications from this report include: Nighttime lighting serves as a useful proxy measure for the rate of relocation of Rohingya refugees from Cox's Bazaar to Bhasan Char in Bangladesh. This data offers evidence consistent with official public estimates that roughly 19,000 Rohingya refugees in total have been relocated to Bhasan Char in 2021, based upon the housing capacity of specific plots on the island experiencing major nighttime lighting growth in 2021. Minority populations within the Rohingya may have been the first groups resettled onto Bhasan Char, as supported by evidence of major nighttime lighting growth in a semi-isolated set of housing plots on the island - perhaps due to the risk these populations previously faced in crowded camps in Cox's Bazaar. Nighttime lighting over existing refugee camps in Cox's Bazaar reveals continued major growth in electrification through early 2021, suggesting that the Government of Bangladesh and the international community have continued to prioritize support to these camps despite the relocation of some refugees to Bhasan Char.

Looking Ahead This report used nighttime lighting data to track the relocation of Rohingya refugees from Cox's Bazaar to Bhasan Char in Bangladesh. It revealed unique patterns of nighttime lighting growth on Bhasan Char across 120 separate housing plots, independently affirming public estimates of the current population of 19,000 refugees on the island. Future analysis of nighttime lighting over the island will likely prove beneficial to those involved in humanitarian planning to support refugees relocated to the island, as well as those involved in promoting disaster resilience and preparing for potential disaster response in support of Rohingya refugees in a monsoon-prone region.  Things To Watch Will nighttime lighting growth continue to serve as a close indicator of the relocation of refugees onto Bhasan Char in 2022? Will nighttime lighting continue to expand at a rapid pace in Cox's Bazaar, despite the relocation of refugees out of specific camps onto Bhasan Char? Will progress be made to ensure freedom of mobility for Rohingya refugees between Bhasan Char and the mainland?

{"article":"A Geospatial Strategy to Locate Future Chinese ICBM Silo Fields.json","text":"China's Military  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors A Geospatial Strategy to Locate Future Chinese ICBM Silo Fields  In partnership with \n Johns Hopkins University \n and written by \n Jason Faust  Latest 3 Silo Complexes Analyzed Impact Future Missile Placement Published May 12 2022 8\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  The People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) has garnered significant attention with respect to the construction of over three hundred missile silos dispersed across three silo fields. This report seeks to investigate the geospatial characteristics of each site and use that data to inform a search strategy. China watchers and analysts should have a systematic method for defining search strategies, and this report serves as a foundational first step in that effort. Based on the size of the delivery system(s) the PLARF is installing, this article investigates the depth of bedrock, slope of the terrain, land cover, and proximity to rail transit as suitable geospatial characteristics for silo field locations. Activity To accomplish the goals stated above, analysis was conducted on three missile complexes that are currently under development in Hami, Yumen, and Hanggin Banner, with the purpose of quantifying each variable mentioned above and leveraging that data to exclude regions that did not meet the criteria for rapid silo construction. Between the three silo complexes, there are currently 319 silos in various stages of completion. This report highlights eight sites that meet or exceed the criteria for silo construction. Article  Graphs  Key Intelligence Questions How many missile silos have been constructed by the People's Liberation Rocket Force? What are the geospatial characteristics of each silo field, and how might those attributes inform a broader search strategy? Key Judgments The development of silo fields at Hami, Yumen, and Hanggin Banner will continue to have a significant geopolitical impact and add strain to the international community's relationship with China - specifically the United States and India. A systematic method to identify future silo field construction and collection efforts will improve future geospatial discoveries. All imagery Sentinel-2 March 2022. Red dots represent silos and white lines represent roads. Background China and Weapons of Mass Destruction The People's Republic of China (PRC) has been developing, producing, and testing nuclear weapons technology since the First Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1954-1955 and tested its first nuclear weapon in 1964. The live testing continued until 1997 when the PRC entered the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The current number of PRC nuclear weapons is unknown, but the most recent estimate in 2015 by the Federation of American Scientists places the arsenal at roughly 350 warheads.1 If this estimate is correct, it would give the PRC the fourth largest nuclear arsenal among the five nuclear weapon states acknowledged by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In 2011, the PRC published a paper that repeated its nuclear policies of maintaining a minimum deterrence strategy with a no-first-use pledge.2 The PRC has not defined what a minimum deterrence policy means, however. Recent People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) deployments such as expansive silo complexes, solid-fueled Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (DF-41), Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (DF-26), and developments such as hypersonic delivery vehicles (DF-ZF) are incongruous at best and ominous at worst. DF-41 Specifications. Source: Center for Strategic and International Studies Framing the Discussion What are China's motivations, and how do they fit into an overall strategy? Experts in and outside of government have questioned China's publicly stated minimum deterrence policy and no-first-use pledge. China will not achieve nuclear parity with Russia or the United States in the near future, but its documented actions show an increase in development and production of its delivery systems, and by inference, an increase in its stockpile. Whether China seeks parity or superiority is not yet clear, but it is on a comprehensive path that would challenge Russian and US positions. China's ramp-up of its nuclear weapons stockpile and increasingly sophisticated delivery systems is nothing new with respect to the modern geopolitical arena. The Soviet Union created a similar climate during The Cold War with the net effect of mutually assured destruction. China may be breathing new life into the international relations theory known as the stability-instability paradox.6 The United States still has a significant advantage in this challenge due to ballistic missile submarines (SSBN), but China can still create a state of mutually assured destruction by constructing hundreds of missile silos and building out a SSBN fleet. This contemporary application of the stability-instability paradox could allow China to pursue \"minor\" conventional actions around the world. Cause for US Concern After the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, the Intelligence Community set major organizational changes in motion to best position themselves for the growing geopolitical threat faced by a more aggressive Beijing.7 The US is particularly concerned about maritime travel in the South China Sea, a kinetic conflict on the Korean Peninsula, and President Xi's public desire to unify China by bringing Taiwan back under Beijing's control. If the United States finds itself in a situation resembling the Cold War with China, then the PRC could feel emboldened to pursue a proxy war or land grab if they assess the risk of a direct conflict with the United States as highly improbable. These developments must play out in the public arena so the US may have the political capital to bring Beijing to the negotiating table to seriously discuss nuclear disarmament similar to the START treaties with the former Soviet Union and the Russian Federation. Certain Pentagon officials are also concerned that China may be pivoting away from its long-stated no-first-use policy declaration, but dissenters argue that the expansion of silo-based systems intends to safeguard the survivability of its retaliatory nuclear forces. Either way, STRATCOM's recent testimony to Congress suggests that it sees recent developments as destabilizing.8 To fully assess the China threat, it is also necessary to consider the capability of the associated delivery system, command and control, readiness, posture, doctrine, and training. By these measures, China is already capable of executing any plausible nuclear employment strategy within their region and will soon be able to do so at intercontinental ranges. As Admiral Charles Richard, STRATCOM Commander wrote in a statement to the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services on April 20, 2021, \"they are no longer a 'lesser included case' of the pacing nuclear threat, Russia.\" Analysis Factors Objective Various silo construction stages at Hanggin Banner. Copyright Maxar 2020, 2021, 2022 Transportation Networks Considering the silo components, manpower, relevant equipment, and raw materials, the construction of one silo, let alone over three hundred, requires a significant amount of infrastructure. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) was originally tasked with building out the railway system across the country. That responsibility was transferred to the China Railway Construction Corporation in 1984, but they continued to maintain a strong relationship with the PLA.10 Since then, the PRC has made significant investments in railroads throughout the country but with an emphasis on the more densely populated eastern part of China. During the Cold War, the Strategic Rocket Forces of the Soviet Union largely constructed missile bases within 40-65 kilometers of the railroad. As it relates to China, this becomes a reasonable assumption and use case for formulating a search strategy. The Soviets did not build massive fields in one location as the Chinese have done, but for the purposes of this study, the rail proximity assumption is reasonable due to China's overall use of rail more broadly throughout the country. Very little detailed and specific open GIS data exists on railroads in China, but the best open-source data stated the rail lines used are used for both passengers and freight11. While it may make more sense to only include dedicated freight-rail lines, there is no discernible difference between the two classifications within the open data available. Therefore, each rail line was treated with equal weight. Major Railroads in China. From: \"China High Speed Railways and Stations (2016)\" by Yifan Li Depth to Bedrock Little original geospatial data exists on bedrock depth in China, but researchers from Scientific Data used borehole samples from the Chinese National Important Geological Borehole Database to reason about this metric.12 They devised a sampling scheme of 6,382 Depth to Bedrock (DTB) observations spread throughout mainland China and used that data to create a country-wide raster layer. The figure below is a map of the final product, which is a 100-meter resolution raster layer that provides the predicted bedrock depth measured in meters. This layer was critical for characterizing existing silo locations and calculating statistics like the mean depth to bedrock for the Hami, Yumen, and Hanggin Banner silo fields. This layer also served as a core dataset for forecasting the locations of potential silo fields based on the hypothesis that these fields require a depth of 25 meters to accommodate the 20-22 meter length of an ICBM such as the DF-41 with additional space for the silo's overall construction. Bedrock Depth in China. From: \"Depth-to-Bedrock Map of China\" by Yan, F., Shangguan, W., Zhang, J. et al. Land Cover & Slope Land Cover Classifications and Characterization at each Silo Field (Original Work) A Digital Elevation Model was created to interpolate surface slope at a 500-meter resolution. The Chinese have been building these silo fields in locations with bare ground and minimal surface slope. The slope distribution of all three silo fields reported a max value of 1.48 degrees, which narrowed the scope to raster tiles with a slope less than or equal to two degrees. Methodology Tools Used ESRI's ArcGIS Pro software was used for all GIS analysis. The specific tools used within ArcGIS will be named and usage will be explained for reproducibility and transparency. Geospatial Characteristics Silo Field Characterization (Original Work) The second question that needed to be addressed was the size of a potential silo field. The \"Average Nearest Neighbor\" tool was used to calculate the average distance, or spacing, between each individual silo. The Yumen site is distributed across two different locations so Yumen North and Yumen South were treated as independent sections. The configuration of silos within Hami and Yumen appear more \"orderly\" (see electro-optical overview imagery above) than the configuration of Hanggin Banner but the spacing was similar amongst all three. These values were used to calculate the size of each individual silo parcel, and expand that in intervals of forty, sixty, eighty, and one hundred silos. The table below highlights the size of a parcel for a single silo at each missile complex, and the estimated square kilometers of a prospective facility which will inform candidate selection in the results. Estimated Silo Field Size (Original Work) Leveraging Geospatial Characteristics to make Down-selections Each of the previous steps led to significant down-selections to the raw raster files. All three rasters were different resolutions, which if not properly mitigated, would have dramatically impacted the integrity of the results. Prior to making down-selections, the higher resolution bedrock and land cover raster layers were down-sampled and aligned with the 500-meter resolution slope layer so each raster tile could be analyzed independently. For each layer, the \"Extract by Mask\" tool was used to only select raster tiles that were within the railroad buffer polygon. The \"Set Null\" tool was then used to assign \"NoData\" to each raster tile that did not meet the bedrock depth, land cover, and slope requirements listed above. The graphic below reflects the first stage of analysis concerning bedrock depth, and demonstrates how effective it can be as a down-selection variable. The bedrock, slope, and land-cover layers were aggregated and filtered based on the following minimum conditions for silo construction: 1. Bedrock depth greater than 25 meters 2. Average surface slope less than 2 degrees Remaining silo field region after bedrock depth down-selection (Original Work) Results Locate Regions Tool The purpose of manipulating and combining these raster files was to programmatically locate regions that are suitable for silo construction. The \"Locate Regions\" was used due to its capability of identifying the most suitable regions, or groups of contiguous raster cells, from an input raster that satisfies a specified evaluation criterion that meets a specific shape and size constraint. The evaluation criteria included the depth to bedrock and the size of a prospective silo field based on the estimated square kilometers required for complexes with forty, sixty, eighty, and one-hundred silos. The intent was to select two prospective silo fields for each size (40\/60\/80\/100 silos) that would accommodate rapid construction, thus the two sites with the highest average bedrock depth were chosen. Potential Silo Field Locations (Original Work) As shown in the map above, the net result was eight candidates of varying size that were predicted to be strong candidates for future construction based on the heuristics covered in the Analysis Factors section. The majority of the sites were located in Western China because that area consisted of flat bare ground, and most importantly, had very deep bedrock relative to the rest of the country. Each candidate is depicted in the imagery below along with metrics related to each parcel's geological characteristics including average bedrock depth and average slope. Future Work Shortcoming of Analysis A key assumption in this report was that the Chinese would almost exclusively use their railway network instead of major roads to transport materials, missiles, and heavy construction equipment. Open literature shows that China has a robust highway system, yet there is little to no literature on the silo construction process in China. Due to the lack of specific information regarding the construction process and requirements, the 25-meter minimum was chosen based on the estimated 20-22 meter length of the DF-41. The PLA has a road-mobile version of the DF-4114\u00a0that could transport the delivery systems to a silo field, but it is the author's position that the construction process would still depend on railroads to construct a silo installation of this size. Moreover, this study assumed that the construction process would depend on rail proximity as in the Soviet Union. A large portion of southwestern China with limited railway transit was excluded, but depth to bedrock and the amount of bare ground would make it a strong candidate for silo field construction. There are also several major railroad connections under construction in the Western part of the country.15 Researchers should monitor the construction of these rail lines as they could be dually used by the PLA.

{"article":"The Rise of Baykar Technologies, Part II_ Operations.json","text":"Technology Analysis  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors The Rise of Turkey's Baykar Technologies, Part II: Operations  In partnership with \n Johns Hopkins University \n and written by \n Owen LeGrone  Latest Drone Production Increased Exponentially Impact Growing Domination of UCAV Export Market Published Sep 4 2022 4\u00a0months, 1\u00a0week Image Credit  Go to map  Overview  Baykar Technologies, based in Istanbul, Turkey, is one of the predominant manufacturers of Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAV) today. This report examines Baykar's production, flight testing, training, and delivery operations using satellite imagery and open sources. Activity The following analysis provides a brief history of Baykar operations in each category, then attempts to quantify their current status. Article  Timeline  Introduction Baykar Technologies is one of the world\u2019s most successful manufacturers of Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAV). Part I of this report examined the development and status of the company's physical infrastructure. This part contains analysis of the ability of that infrastructure to support four key activities: production, testing, training, and delivery. Key Intelligence Questions 1. What is Baykar's production and training capacity?\n2. What visual aspects are associated with Baykar operations?\n3. How do UCAV systems move from production to testing and delivery or deployment? Methods This GEOINT-enhanced economic analysis, like other standard economic analyses, is focused on capability and company efficiencies. It incorporates commercially available satellite imagery alongside numerous other open sources. Baykar and its most prominent executives, Haluk Bayraktar (CEO) and Sel\u00e7uk Bayraktar (CTO), generate a substantial amount of content via social media and through their corporate website. Turkish and international media also contributed useful information. In many cases, social media and other media content were geolocated to a particular site, providing coverage of that site unavailable through satellite imagery alone. For further clarity, the source of each observation cited is noted in the text or in a caption. A lexicon of specific terms listed in Table 1 is used to communicate estimative probability. Table 1: Terms used to convey probability. Original work by author.  Executive Summary Baykar likely increased annual production of its flagship Bayraktar TB2 UCAV by as much as 40 times between 2014 and 2022. This was accomplished by adding production space, hiring more workers, and streamlining production processes.\nAk\u0131nc\u0131 UCAV production has likely trended moderately upward since series production began in February 2021, although the outbreak of war in Ukraine probably caused some disruption to supply chains.\nBaykar likely has the ability to produce between 142 and 240 TB2 UCAVs, or 23 to 40 standard Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), per year. Yearly production of the Ak\u0131nc\u0131 UCAV is likely between 6 and 15.\nBaykar uses separate training centers for the two UCAV models that it manufactures. Both can likely process three to four classes of drone pilots and ground crew per year, totaling between 150 to 320 personnel for the TB2 and between 300 and 400 for the Ak\u0131nc\u0131.\nBaykar likely delivers all or nearly all of its products, including weapons, to customers by air freight through Tekirda\u011f-\u00c7orlu Airport. The pace of deliveries likely increased rapidly between 2019 and 2022. Production History When it first transitioned to manufacturing UAVs in 2004, Baykar operated within a rented workshop in the Topkap\u0131 district of Istanbul (Topkap\u0131 Maltepe Yolu Cad. Canayak\u0131n sitesi A blok No: 6). While its exact size is unknown, contemporary images indicate that it was small, likely 200m\u00b2 or less. Today, this space houses the Turkish Technology Team, a nonprofit organization founded by Haluk Bayraktar. In 2006 the company relocated production to the nearby Ikitelli Organized Industrial Zone (OSB Metal \u0130\u015f Sanayi Sitesi 15. Blok D:1 \u0130kitelli, Ba\u015fak\u015fehir, \u0130stanbul) in two separate workshops totaling 1,000m\u00b2. Photographs and videos of the interior show that one or both shops were divided into upper and lower floors, with components manufactured on the upper floor and final assembly taking place on the lower. Unfortunately, analysis of satellite imagery revealed little to no distinctive activity around this building while it was occupied by Baykar, likely due to the many other manufacturing businesses nearby, the lack of open storage space, and the low production rate. Haluk Bayraktar stated in 2022 that this factory could produce one TB2 UCAV per month, although the number of deliveries made (see eliveries) indicates that actual production was closer to one unit every two months until 2017, the last year of operation. Figure 1: TB2s and GCS trailers in final assembly at the Ikitelli workshop, circa 2015. Source: Turkish Machinery Exporters' Association (MA\u0130B).  Development Production moved to Baykar's current Esenyurt production campus by August 2017 (see Esenyurt section in Part I). Usage of the two operational factory buildings at Esenyurt likely changed over time as Baykar took steps to increase the rate of production and, in the case of the Ak\u0131nc\u0131 program, initiate a new production line. From 2017 until 2019, the entire production cycle took place inside the main factory building. Video taken in 2019 showed that large parts of the second factory were empty, with its primary visible function being to host a large structural test rig for the Ak\u0131nc\u0131. The January 2021 diagram of the TB2 production process in Figure 2, which largely matches architectural renderings of the main factory interior, suggests that most production activities took place there. Figure 2: A diagram of TB2 manufacturing presented in early 2021. While somewhat abstract, it essentially corresponds to the layout of the construction hall in the main factory building. All captions translated from Turkish by author. Source: Baykar YouTube channel.  Between 2019 and 2022, Baykar optimized usage of floor space within the main factory building. The production floor layout observed from 2017 onwards was last seen on 28 Jan 2021. Photographs from March 2022 showed that bulky fixed equipment, including a gantry-based Coordinate Measuring Machine, had been removed from the Load Test area of the floor along with the test rigs themselves. Rather than moving through the factory parallel to the north and south walls, TB2 UCAVs under construction from 2021 onward have been lined perpendicular to them, possibly in an effort to maximize use of space. The image in Figure 3, dated 12 Mar 2022, shows at least 13 TB2s on the southern half of the floor arranged perpendicular to the south wall, including 6 in an advanced stage of completion. Figure 3: The main factory floor on 12 Mar 2022. Source: Baykar Instagram account.  Baykar also likely relocated some processes from the first to the second factory building to increase production efficiency. While in 2019 26 TB2s were sighted simultaneously on the production floor, about half that number was more typical in 2022. TB2s in the Structural Integration and Structural Load Test stages were no longer present in ground images captured in March 2021. Their place was occupied by Ak\u0131nc\u0131 and more advanced TB2 airframes. It is likely that Structural Integration and Structural Load Test activities for both the TB2 and Ak\u0131nc\u0131 were relocated, freeing space on the main floor for aircraft in final assembly. In addition, the corner of the main factory previously devoted to ground equipment was occupied nearly or fully by aircraft in 2022, implying that this production area was moved to the second factory as well. See the attached file aykar TB2 Production Stages for additional observations on the production process. Figures 4 and 5 are intended to show some of the changes that took place within the main factory building between 2021 and 2022.

Sources: ET\u00dcD Mimarl\u0131k Facebook account, Baykar YouTube channel, and Baykar Instagram account.  The expansion of Baykar's production efforts is reflected by the expansion of its workforce. The company initially grew at a measured pace, from an initial 7 employees in 2004 to 35 by 2011. From 2014, however, it began hiring much more quickly. The number of employees expanded by over 5 times between October 2015 and December 2019, from 110 to 600, and again by over 4 times between December 2019 and September 2022, reaching 2,700. It is highly likely that most, though not all, of these employees work at the Esenyurt campus. See the attached aykar Employee Growth file for more information. In addition to expanding its factory in Esenyurt, Baykar has attempted to open production facilities abroad. In September 2021, the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the company would construct a factory in Ukraine for TB2 UCAVs, an action anticipated in a December 2020 agreement between Turkey and Ukraine. Ground had not been broken at the time of the Russian invasion in February 2022, but Baykar continued its efforts. On 08 Aug 2022, the Turkish ambassador to Ukraine stated that Baykar had acquired land and begun construction on a factory, with foundations to be laid by the end of 2022. Haluk Bayraktar indicated that the plant would eventually produce the Ak\u0131nc\u0131 and K\u0131z\u0131lelma UCAVs in addition to the TB2, and would feature a complete production line similar to the one in Turkey. Rumors of a second planned production line in the UAE were denied by Baykar. Current Operations While Baykar serially produced three types of unmanned aircraft and a myriad of related systems in 2022, this section of the analysis will focus on its two large UCAVs, the TB2 and Ak\u0131nc\u0131, as a measure of overall production capacity. Credible sources have made several claims about Baykar\u2019s production rate which we may assess. In September 2019, the Turkish government stated that the company could manufacture 46 TB2s per year, a figure projected to increase to 92 TB2 and 24 Ak\u0131nc\u0131 over 10 years. CTO Sel\u00e7uk Bayraktar claimed in August 2021 that Baykar had a production capacity of \u201c1 or 2\u201d Ak\u0131nc\u0131 per month (12-24 per year) and in May 2022 that Baykar could produce 200 TB2 UCAVs per year. In August 2022, Haluk Bayraktar claimed that the production capacity was 20 TB2s per month, or 240 per year. Table 2: 2021-2022 Observations, Esenyurt. Original work by author.

See accompanying Baykar Product Deliveries and Baykar Production Statistics files in Data Sources for more information.  Serial production of the Ak\u0131nc\u0131 began on 04 Feb 2021, and five production Ak\u0131nc\u0131 were delivered before the end of the year with a sixth ready for delivery. In November 2021, Baykar concluded an agreement to procure 30 Ukrainian Ivchenko-Progress Al-450T turboprop engines for the Ak\u0131nc\u0131 over the next twelve months. Accounting for possible spare engines, this indicates that it probably planned to build between 13 and 15 production aircraft during this time. However, the February 2022 outbreak of war in Ukraine likely disrupted plans. By June 18, 2022, only three additional production Ak\u0131nc\u0131 were confirmed to have flown, for a total of nine, although additional unreported deliveries to export customers likely took place as well. It is reasonable to assume a lower bound of six aircraft per year, identical to the rate in 2021, and an upper bound of 15. Flight Testing History Figure 7: This image, likely taken in 2009 at Sinop, shows the two \u201c\u00c7ald\u0131ran\u201d aircraft together. They were smaller and differed from their TB2 successors in having twin vertical tails instead of an inverted V-tail. The aircraft nearer the camera was lost, while the one in the background is now on display in the Esenyurt main factory. Source: Baykar website (2011 archived version).  Development Once established at Ke\u015fan Flight Training and Test Center in 2014, flight test operations were regularized and the test fleet expanded. Two TB2 prototype aircraft used for flight tests, \u201cPT1\u201d (civil registry TC-ERB) and \u201cPT2\u201d (civil registry TC-SRM), were built in 2013. By 2018 they were supplanted by two additional aircraft, \u201cT-PT1\u201d and \u201cT-PT2.\u201d Unlike their predecessors, these were equipped with four wing hardpoints and bomb racks for munitions. Figure 8: \"T-PT1\" and \"T-PT2\" together at the Baykar-sponsored Teknofest technology exhibition in September 2018. Note hardpoints for weapons under the starboard wing of \u201cT-PT2.\u201d Source: defenceturk.net.  The first TB2 flight tests were of the aircraft\u2019s performance parameters and flight control software. Customer acceptance tests took place in November 2014, prior to the initial delivery of six aircraft, for a Turkish government delegation. In 2015, the \u201cPT1\u201d testbed trialed an ADS-B transponder and a Wescam MX-series electro-optical turret. Initial weapons integration tests for the TB2 were held at Konya Air Force Base in southeast Turkey in December 2015, and the first live weapons tests with MAM-series munitions in April 2016. Weapons tests have been held at Ke\u015fan as well. The first one documented, in July 2017, saw a TB2 (likely \u201cT-PT2\u201d) drop a MAM-L laser-guided bomb on a target located on Hedef Island in the Gulf of Saros. \u201cT-PT1\u201d tested the Bozok laser-guided bomb on a similar target on 01 Nov 2018. In November 2020, \u201cT-PT1\u201d testbed performed flight tests with the Aselsan CATS electro-optical system, including a drop of an inert munition on Hedef. CATS subsequently became standard on production TB2s for the Turkish military due to the Canadian embargo of the MX-15 system. In December 2020, a SATCOM-equipped TB2S UCAV, possibly a prototype, conducted a test flight from Ke\u015fan. This was the first test flight known to have been conducted alongside a Baykar-owned Pipestrel Sinus motor glider acting as a chase plane. The first prototype of the Ak\u0131nc\u0131, \u201cPT-1,\u201d flew from \u00c7orlu Flight Training and Test Center in December 2019. It was soon followed by \u201cPT-2\u201d in August 2020 and \u201cPT-3\u201d in March 2021. All of these aircraft were representative of the initial A variant equipped with Ukrainian Al-450T turboprop engines. \u201cPT-4\u201d first flew in March 2022, and \u201cPT-5,\u201d likely in May 2022. These were representative of the B variant with Canadian PT6 engines. Similarly to its smaller predecessor, most early Ak\u0131nc\u0131 flights in 2019 and 2020 were dedicated to testing performance. An Ak\u0131nc\u0131 prototype conducted the type\u2019s first live weapons test with a MAM-T laser-guided bomb on Hedef Island in April 2021. At least one new prototype has been manufactured per year since 2019, including two in 2022; this is likely due to the complexity of the aircraft, the variety of payloads it can carry, and the fact that at least three different engine configurations are planned for production models. In September 2021, Baykar concluded an agreement with Ukraine to open a new test facility there. Construction of this facility, as well as the training and production facilities also planned in Ukraine, was delayed by the outbreak of war and had not begun as of August 2022. Current Operations Flight test activity by Baykar can be divided into four categories: Prototype Tests. This includes tests of engines, software, and all onboard equipment as originally designed for the aircraft. Performed by Baykar-owned aircraft with tail codes in the \u201cPT\u201d (prototype) range, although many of these have now transitioned into other roles as well. Pre-Delivery Tests. This includes tests intended to ensure that aircraft are ready to be delivered to the customer. Typically performed with production aircraft. Acceptance Tests. This includes tests performed to satisfy the terms of a contract signed with the customer. The TB2 underwent its acceptance tests for the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) in 2014, although other customers have held their own acceptance tests since then. Typically performed with production aircraft. Product Development Tests. This can include new software, weapons, or equipment that will be applied to new aircraft in the future, including weapons. Note that this is distinct from military exercises by UCAVs that are serving with operational units. Commonly, though not exclusively, performed with the \"PT\" and \u201cT-PT\u201d series aircraft (\u201cT-\u201d may stand for Test). All production Baykar UCAVs undergo pre-delivery flight tests and possibly acceptance tests as well. Analysis provided by IntelAssess, derived from flight tracking data, supports the notion that complete UAS, including multiple UCAVs with contiguous serials and their ground systems, undergo flight tests together. Most UAS are composed of six aircraft, although some variation is known. After arriving in disassembled form at the Ke\u015fan or \u00c7orlu facilities from the Esenyurt factory, the aircraft are re-assembled, then undergo technical inspections and pre-delivery test flights. Individual production UCAVs are known to have undergone at least five such flights before delivery. Developmental flight test operations appear to normally involve company-owned aircraft and occur sporadically as new equipment, weapons, or software is integrated. The most recognizable test aircraft is the black-painted TB2 \u201cPT1.\u201d At least four TB2 testbeds (\u201cPT1,\u201d \u201cPT2,\u201d \u201cT-PT1,\u201d and \u201cT-PT2\u201d) and five Ak\u0131nc\u0131 testbeds (\u201cPT-1,\u201d \u201cPT-2,\u201d \u201cPT-3,\u201d \u201cPT-4\u201d, and \u201cPT-5\u201d) existed in July 2022. \u201cPT1\u201d was filmed at the factory hangar in Esenyurt in August 2019, indicating that test aircraft are returned to the production campus for diagnostics, repairs, or new modifications. Standard production TB2s, likely aircraft owned by the Turkish armed forces, have also occasionally been used for tests. Although Baykar aircraft in operational military service conduct exercises at a variety of locations, flight tests administered by Baykar are typically conducted from either Ke\u015fan or \u00c7orlu. TB2 test aircraft operate primarily from Ke\u015fan with some deployments to \u00c7orlu, and all Ak\u0131nc\u0131 test aircraft operate from \u00c7orlu. On 01 Jul 2022, production TB2 \u201cT172,\u201d operating from Ke\u015fan, performed \u201cbuddy\u201d laser designation for a guided munition dropped by Ak\u0131nc\u0131 prototype \u201cPT-4\u201d at the Hedef range, an example of cooperation between the two test sites. Aircraft flying from Ke\u015fan use the test range on Hedef island in the Gulf of Saros for weapons tests. Ak\u0131nc\u0131 UCAVs based out of \u00c7orlu have conducted live weapons tests on Hedef and along Turkey\u2019s northern Black Sea coast near Sinop. Baykar-operated Pipestrel Sinus motor gliders, likely serving as chase planes in support of test activity, have been sighted at \u00c7orlu in satellite imagery dated 25 Mar 2021, 20 Nov 2021, and 09 Feb 2022. One of these also operated from Ke\u015fan during tests of the TB2S in December 2020. In addition to flight tests, GCS and other ground systems also undergo testing at both locations. Baykar retains two truck-mounted TB2 GCS trailers and one Ak\u0131nc\u0131 trailer at Ke\u015fan and \u00c7orlu, respectively, which can likely support both test and training operations. Training History Flight training on the first operational Baykar UAV, the Baykar Mini, was conducted alongside army units in southeast Turkey from 2008 onward, while training on the Malazgirt helicopter UAV took place in \u015e\u0131rnak. Baykar began conducting operator training on the TB2 for its first customer, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), in July 2015. The first training course for which details are available took place in the summer of 2016 at Van Ferit Melen airport for EGM (General Directorate of Security) drone operators. Development Table 4: Baykar Training Courses for Ak\u0131nc\u0131 and TB2, 2015-2022. Original work by author. Sources: Media and social media reports. See accompanying Baykar Training Sessions file in Data Sources for more information.  Some facilities used for training are known to have undergone certain refinements. For instance, rooms were installed on the previously empty eastern part of the upper floor of the large hangar at Ke\u015fan between 2018 and 2019, some of which serve as classrooms. The large hangar at \u00c7orlu contains two floors of side offices on the second and third floors. Compared to those at Ke\u015fan, they seem to have been completed at approximately the same time as the hangar itself. As with its production and testing operations, Baykar planned to open additional facilities in Ukraine to support UCAV training. According to a 2021 memorandum, the first such facility would be located near Vasylkyiv in Kyiv Oblast, likely on the site of the existing Vasylkyiv Air Base. Russian forces inflicted considerable damage on this base and much of the surrounding area during the initial stages of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022; the current planned location of the training center, if different, is unknown. Construction had not yet begun in August 2022. Current Operations Using its two training facilities, Baykar can instruct trainees for the Ak\u0131nc\u0131 and TB2 UCAVs simultaneously. The main hangars at both facilities host matriculation and graduation ceremonies, and likely most ground instruction as well. It is unknown whether personnel train on the same aircraft that have been delivered to their organization. Baykar has stated that the Ke\u015fan Flight Training and Test Center possesses \u201cits own UAV fleet\u201d for training, but this is likely supplemented in some cases, as TB2s with Azerbaijan Air Force roundels were seen at Ke\u015fan in 2021 during a course for Azeri personnel. Most classes for the TB2 course appear to consist of between 50 and 80 people, including pilots, payload operators, and ground crew. This class size likely corresponds with the number of personnel needed to operate one UAS. Baykar stated in a 2019 product catalog that its overall training program for the TB2 consumed 11 to 13 weeks, including a \u201cone-week introduction, followed by three to four weeks of theoretical and system trainings, and seven to eight weeks of flight simulations, payload operator flight trainings and applied flight trainings.\u201d The exact length likely varies based on the logistical demands of transporting, housing, and processing each group. It is likely that the maximum training capacity for TB2 crew is three to four classes, or 150 to 320 personnel, per year. The true number would depend on the number of trainers employed by Baykar as well as the amount of time required to transition between courses. Available information indicates that the Ak\u0131nc\u0131 training course is equivalent to the TB2 course in length, despite the greater complexity of the platform. The first course lasted approximately seven months, but it also had an unusually large number of students. It was likely intended to establish a baseline of trained personnel who were familiar with Ak\u0131nc\u0131 within the Turkish military. The classes that followed graduated approximately three months apart. It is therefore likely that Baykar can process up to four classes per year, as with the TB2. The Ak\u0131nc\u0131 classes completed by July 2022 averaged approximately 102 persons, about twice the size of the average TB2 graduating class. This makes it likely that Baykar can graduate between 300 and 400 personnel per year from its Ak\u0131nc\u0131 training program. Delivery History Baykar likely delivered its early products directly to the customer without making use of a designated transshipment hub. The first batch of TB2 aircraft built could have been transferred from their flight test location at Ke\u015fan to Batman Air Force Base by road, considering the length of the journey, although air transport is possible. The base variant of the TB2, incapable of venturing more than 300km from its ground station even with relay systems, lacked the communications range to attempt the approximately 1,300km direct flight between these two locations. The need for long-distance shipments to customers arose after the TB2 obtained its first export order from Qatar in March 2018. Transport aircraft large enough to make these deliveries could not land at Ke\u015fan Military Airport, so another airport or sea port must have been used, considering the cost, duration, and customs difficulties of making such a journey by land. However, the exact location from which shipping occurred is unknown. The TB2 aircraft and GCS were delivered to Qatar by 01 Feb 2019. Development The first detailed information about shipping practices for Baykar products emerged in late 2019, after the Turkish government supplied the TB2 system to the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) in violation of UN sanctions. A subsequent investigation by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Panel of Experts revealed several key facts: Between 14 and 18 May 2019, the cargo ship MV Amazon transported at least two green-painted Ford 2533 trucks with antenna platforms like those of TB2 mobile GCS, but with no GCS trailers or antennas mounted, to Libya. The ship departed from Samsun, Turkey, and stopped at Izmir before reaching Tripoli. This suggests that the trucks were shipped separately from the rest of the system. While the Panel noted unconfirmed reports that the first four or six TB2 UCAVs were also shipped by sea, no images or conclusive evidence existed. However, it did find evidence that at least eight TB2, the majority of the 12 known to have been shipped to the GNA, were delivered by air using a fleet of chartered Ukrainian An-12 and Il-76 transport aircraft. The TB2s were disassembled for transport and reassembled after arriving at their destination. Manifests obtained by the Panel indicated that the aircraft transported TB2s in separate fuselage, wing, and tail sections. Other UAS equipment, including Ground Control Stations, was disassembled and transported in the same flights as the UCAVs. All flights delivering TB2 systems to Libya originated at Ankara Esenboga International Airport. This location is substantially removed from Baykar\u2019s facilities, which are much closer to several Istanbul-area airports. It is possible that Ankara was used due to the direct government-to-government nature of the assistance, which made it different than a standard commercial sale by Baykar. Ankara could also have been chosen to conceal the nature of the cargo. Tekirda\u011f-\u00c7orlu Atat\u00fcrk Airport possessed dedicated cargo storage and handling facilities as early as 2012. However, Baykar likely adopted it as a primary transshipment center during 2019, when the \u00c7orlu Flight Training and Test Center there became operational. The airport had certainly assumed this role by 2021. On 12 Jun 2021, a Turkish Air Force (TuAF) A400M transport flew from \u00c7orlu to Northern Cyprus coincident with the appearance of the TB2 system in this disputed territory. In September, another A400M flew from \u00c7orlu to an unknown location, probably within Turkey. Between July 2021 and July 2022, a series of chartered and military transport aircraft made flights from \u00c7orlu to Azerbaijan, Niger, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, and Ukraine, all of which are TB2 customers. Current Operations Aircraft engaged in deliveries from \u00c7orlu are known to frequent the commercial terminal on the southern side of the airport (see \u00c7orlu section in Part I). Prior to delivery, UAS components are likely stored at the 3,500m2 warehouse operated by Odrap Air Cargo, which offers \u201cfully computerized\u201d cargo handling and is also conveniently near the airport customs office. This is the only such warehouse at \u00c7orlu. The airport hosts specialized cargo equipment, including loading vehicles and wheeled dollies. As in deliveries to Libya, the aircraft and ground systems are likely disassembled, the former into wing, fuselage, and tail sections, and shipped in multiple flights to the customer. Baykar likely prefers to separate its transshipment business from its Ak\u0131nc\u0131 test operations as much as possible to improve operational efficiency. However, it is possible that Baykar handles some shipments directly from its test center or the adjacent military apron at \u00c7orlu. An Il-76 or Il-78 transport aircraft was visible on the military apron in ground video footage dated 02 Mar 2022, indicating a visit from a foreign military or civil charter airline. Its appearance coincided with the time period that a Pakistani Air Force Il-78 was present at \u00c7orlu and an interval (February to March, 2022) in which TB2 UCAVs were being delivered from \u00c7orlu to Pakistan.

Source: Baykar YouTube channel.  Deliveries of the Ak\u0131nc\u0131 to customers within Turkey are likely conducted by direct flights. Two Ak\u0131nc\u0131 flew nonstop from \u00c7orlu to Baku, Azerbaijan on 21 May 2022, demonstrating the long range of the type. Ak\u0131nc\u0131 UCAVs are likely to be disassembled for delivery to more distant customers, like Pakistan, in the same manner as the TB2.

Conclusion Baykar has expanded all aspects of its operations to match its emerging stature as a key player in the global arms marketplace. Production of the TB2 UCAV was likely expanded by a factor of between 24 and 40 between 2014 and 2022. It has increased more moderately for the Ak\u0131nc\u0131 UCAV between 2021 and 2022, likely due to the complexity of this system as well as the renewed outbreak of war in Ukraine. Training and flight testing operations, mostly ad hoc between 2004 and 2014, were systematized and localized at purpose-built facilities between 2014 and 2022. Baykar can now conduct comprehensive training for all of its products at these facilities. Finally, the company established an international air transport infrastructure between 2019 and 2022. As its export successes show no sign of abating, Baykar will likely continue to expand its operations commensurately with its infrastructure in the near future.

In partnership with \n CSIS \n and written by \n Heather Conley, \n Matthew Melino, \n and Joseph Bermudez  Latest Increased Radar Activity on Wrangel Island Impact Russian Military Infrastructure on Wrangel Island Published Feb 13 2019 3\u00a0years, 11\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  In 2007 Russia re-prioritized the Arctic in keeping with Vladimir Putin's vision of restoring Russia's status as a great power. Now more than a decade later, Russia's military returns to the Arctic with strategic implications for the United States.  Wrangel Island exemplifies Russia\u2019s growing Arctic military footprint and its strategic ambitions. The island is nearly 300 miles from the Alaskan coast and houses a Sopka-2 radar; the most easterly placed radar installation in what is becoming a \u201cprotective dome\u201d to defend Russia\u2019s Arctic domain. Activity An early warning and cueing radar system on Wrangel Island has limited strategic value as a stand-alone piece of equipment. However, when viewed as part of a larger network of state-of-the-art radars covering the entirety of Russia\u2019s northern borders, including the Arctic Ocean and Russia\u2019s coastline, it may have greater strategic importance.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  The Issue\". . . whoever holds the Arctic, holds the world. I think it is the most important strategic place in the world.\" These solemn words were uttered in 1935 before a House of Representatives Committee by a retired American general and aviator, Billy Mitchell, who presciently foresaw the Arctic as a vital region for early detection against missile and aviation threats to prevent an attack against the United States. But at the end of the Cold War, the Arctic ceased to be a strategically important place for either the United States or the Russian Federation. But by the 2007-2008 time frame, Russia began to re-prioritize the Arctic both economically and militarily--in keeping with Vladimir Putin's vision of restoring Russia's status as a great power and harnessing the Arctics economic potential. Now more than a decade later, Russia has returned to the Arctic militarily with important strategic implications for the United States. Introduction In 2007, the Russian Federation resumed regular air patrols over the Arctic Ocean and penetrated the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) 12-mile air defense identification zone around Alaska 18 times. Since 2007, Russia has adopted a series of policies and strategies and amended its military and maritime doctrines to include the Arctic region, emphasizing the need to protect Russia's Arctic territory and to project influence and power beyond its Arctic coastlines. In 2012, Russia announced the creation of an Arctic brigade and announced it would establish a missile defense system and deploy fighter aircraft to Novaya Zemlya, its northwestern archipelago, which separates the Barents and Kara Seas in 2013. By 2014, Russia announced an ambitious military force posture in the Arctic, which consisted of a new strategic command for the Arctic zone (the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command), the reopening of 50 former Soviet Arctic military bases, an increase in Russian special forces in the region by 30 percent by 2015, and a significant infrastructure program, which included \"13 air defense radar stations, an aviation training ground, and 10 technical radar and air guidance stations in the Arctic region.\" As Russia enhanced its military posture and forces in the Arctic, it concentrated on exercising its new capabilities in the context of territorial defense and power projection. In 2015, the Russian military launched an unannounced large-scale military exercise that involved more than 45,000 Russian forces, 15 submarines, and 41 warships and practiced full combat readiness in the Arctic. Russia's Northern Fleet, home to Russia's sea-based nuclear deterrent, conducted 4,700 exercises in 2017. The Zapad-2017 exercise featured missile strikes from its new base on Kotelny Island in the East Siberian Sea, where new facilities were completed along with now modernized bases in Novaya Zemlya and Franz-Josef Land, in the Barents Sea. In 2018, the Northern Fleet held around 3,800 test combat training exercises, with many designed to enhance both power-projection capabilities as well as protect strategic posts including the New Siberian Islands that are near potential oil and gas reserves and straddle the Northern Sea Route (NSR). Russian anti-submarine aircraft as well as attack and reconnaissance aircraft conducted over 100 Arctic Ocean patrols in 2018. The Russian military has already announced a new series of Arctic exercises, Tsentr-2019 (August-September), which will test new Russian weapons and air defense systems. A Focus on Remote Arctic Islands and Air Defense Systems: Wrangel Island as an Example Russia has significantly strengthened its military presence in its northernmost archipelagos by upgrading its bases on Wrangel Island, Kotelny Island, Franz Josef Land, on the shore of the Kara Sea, Alykel, Tiksi, Chokurdakh, Chersky, Kigelyakh, and Taymylyr. Many of these installations have airfields or will be equipped with with 2,500-meter runways that can receive Russian fighter aircraft. Similarly, each of these installations has or is scheduled to receive a radar detachment capable of improving domain awareness in Arctic airspace, and many are equipped with modern and sophisticated weaponry including the Rubezh coastal missile systems and the Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft weapon systems. It has been reported that Russia has deployed S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to the Novaya Zemlya archipelago and to the Yakutian port of Tiksi. Why has Russia stationed air defense assets on remote Arctic islands? Northern Fleet Commander Admiral Nikolay Yevmenov described these assets in August 2018 as a \"protective dome\" of anti-aircraft missile units strung along the Arctic to defend the airspace above the Russian Arctic. Is this the case? Source: Wikimedia Commons Wrangel Island, an island nearly 300 miles from the Alaskan coast, is a clear example of Russia's growing Arctic military footprint and its strategic ambition, which may have implications for U.S. national security. In late August 2014, the Russian navy conducted a preliminary assessment of Wrangel Island in preparation for the establishment of a new naval base which would be \"the first-ever naval base on (Wrangel Island).\" Satellite imagery shows that actual construction of the new naval base likely began sometime between July 2015 and April 2016 and included the replacement of an abandoned and derelict Cold War era installation at Ushakovskiy.1 The new base includes a signature trefoil structure (three interconnected buildings designed to withstand extreme cold temperatures) as well as a number of support installations, such as the construction of a Sopka-2 radar installation. According to Russian officials, the installation will control civilian air traffic, provide meteorological data and monitor airspace for potentially hostile targets. But the Sopka-2 on Wrangel Island is a 3D dual-use S-band air-route radar with a range of 350km. It faces east in an arc stretching from the Beaufort Sea in the north to the Bering Strait in the south, but its 350km maximum range means that its coverage does not extend into either. Additionally, the location of the Sopka-2 is below the peaks of the islands Gora Sovetskaya mountain to the west and northwest, which results in some terrain masking to avoid potential low- and medium-altitude threats from that direction. The significance of this limitation is unclear as the area to the west may be covered by other radar systems.2 The first indications of the Sopka-2 installation were observed in commercial satellite imagery from May 13, 2016.3 The location chosen for the radar side is approximately 1,500 meters north northwest and above the trefoil base for safety reasons and 675 meters north northwest and above the communications facility to minimize interference. See trefoil structure for reference then note North arrow for direction to communications and radar sections of base.  Subsequent imagery from July 21, 2016, shows that the Sopka-2 installation and its elevated radome housing the systems three antennas was externally completed and enclosed by a tall wire fence.4 An elevated cable run--likely carrying data, communications, and backup power cables--was also in place connecting the installation to the communications facility and main base. Although tentative, the radar may not have been operational at this time. A subsequent image from August 31, 2018, shows a neatly organized pile of discarded shipping crates, which possibly contained the internal equipment required to complete the internal installation of the system. Initial tests of the Sopka-2 facility occurred in January during a simulation exercise. Zoomed in shot of communications section.  Zoomed in shot of radar section.  More work at radar section.  Is This Important? As one of its most easterly situated radar systems in the Russian Arctic, the Wrangel Island Sopka-2 radar is likely designed to supplement Russia's strategic early warning radar network and to detect U.S. aircraft. When viewed in isolation, an early warning radar system on Wrangel Island has limited strategic value and could easily be discounted. However, when viewed as part of a larger network of state-of-the-art radars covering the entirety of Russia's northern borders, including the Arctic Ocean and Russia's coastline, it may have greater importance. The Sopka-2 is a cueing radar, which means it collects data that could be used to direct more powerful radars located closer to the Russian mainland. The network would fill gaps over the Arctic and when combined with new over-the-horizon radars, would establish a detection field ranging from 900 to 1,200 miles beyond the country's borders. Russia's military footprint on Wrangel Island could gather intelligence on, detect, and possibly impact future U.S. military activity in the region. The Sopka-2 radars 350 km range and its intelligence gathering capabilities allows Russia to potentially gather intelligence and detect activity originating from U.S. military installations such as Eielson Air Force Base (AFB) and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson as well as Fort Greely army base, a key missile defense site and home to U.S. Ground-based Midcourse Defense interceptors. The pace of U.S. investments at Fort Greely has accelerated since 2013, primarily in response to a series of missile tests by North Korea and includes $200 million from Congress to add a fourth missile field with 20 additional interceptors over the next four years. The recently released U.S. missile defense strategy also increases the number of ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely from 44 to 64 over the next several years. Eielson AFB is projected to receive 54 F-35s between 2020 and 2022, increasing the capacity of the base in light of its strategic importance to defending the United States in the Indo-Pacific region. Elmendorf AFB is also the headquarters of Alaskan Command (ALCOM) and one of three NORAD regions that defend North American airspace which Russian bombers test from time to time. As Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson recently noted, superiority in the Arctic will depend heavily on airpower, which places renewed emphasis on early warning detection systems and aircraft. At present, it appears that the Wrangel Island radar system tracks regional and local air defense--including the provision of threat information from incoming aircraft--to local and regional surface-to-air missile units and air defense interceptors.5 But as Russia's aerial advancements in the Arctic advance, Russia may achieve integrated air and missile defense superiority. References and Notes 1. Although recent commercial satellite imagery of Wrangel Island is readily available, weather conditions (e.g., snow, heavy cloud coverage, etc.) in the region often make ground observation very challenging, if not impossible. Additionally, historical commercial satellite imagery of the island is somewhat limited and subject to the same climactic challenges. 2.

We observed variation in the provision of housing, training facilities and quality of infrastructure supporting workers' commutes.  Imagery can provide insight into the level of support a zone provides for its workers, but often leaves unanswered questions. Contextual research about how these facilities are being used is important to providing a balanced assessment. Activity The focus of our imagery analysis is on cataloging facilities that would be used towards bettering the life of the resident workers. Housing, training facilities and even paved access roads to the entrance of the zone for commuting are all included.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  How are we evaluating? Social sustainability presents unique challenges when using an approach based on satellite imagery. While all our indicators rely on physical proxies, social sustainability is also heavily influenced by the behavior of zone operators and workers. Because of this, our indicators in the categories of health, education, quality of life, and labor relations necessarily include a blend of imagery and contextual research. Indicators Health: Chinese overseas SEZs exist in developing countries where medical infrastructure widely varies in availability and quality. This is difficult to ascertain via imagery alone. At minimum, a hospital or clinic within close proximity of a zone increases the chance of timely care for zone staff in a medical emergency.1 We evaluate the distance of a zone to medical facilities as proxy for healthcare capacity, supplementing imagery with open-source research on quality of care, availability, and cost where reports are available. Education: For host countries, SEZs may offer the potential to develop a more skilled labor force able to participate in higher value-added activities. Beyond standard job training, additional vocational training can occur inside a tenant company or in a dedicated training facility. We examine zones for the presence of identifiable training facilities (including those constructed by zone management). Where applicable and where open-source reports are available, we also consider the presence of local universities and vocational schools that have a formal relationship with a given zone. We acknowledge physical installations like classrooms may not illustrate the full extent of training, which may conducted inside other SEZ or resident firm buildings. Additionally, the amount and quality of vocational training also vary dramatically by industry and firm.2 We supplement our analysis with survey data for specific zones, where available. Quality of Life: This indicator preliminarily examines transit and housing for zone workers. We evaluate the quality of infrastructure leading to the zone, and whether or not the zone provides worker housing. Infrastructure can include well-paved roads that provide easy access, and\/or sponsored transit for commuters. We do not directly address commute times due to a lack of systemic data for all zones, and are not able to draw direct conclusions on housing quality or overcrowding. We supplement with open-source reports and media interviews. Labor Relations: We draw on open-source reporting, rather than imagery, to qualitatively evaluate workforce issues for our selected zones; for example, firms within each zone may compensate workers poorly. For this indicator, we do not draw directly on satellite imagery. What did we see in the imagery? Health: Access to healthcare and service quality widely vary in China-funded SEZs. The mining operation in Chambishi, Zambia, saw an explosion in 2005 which killed dozens of miners.3 At the Chambishi copper smelter, which started operations years after that incident, in 2008, we see some evidence of the welfare of workers being accounted for.The smelter complex appears to have a first-aid clinic on site, with an ambulance also visible in this ground-level photograph. However, for an industry with an abundance of heavy machinery and with multiple mines operating, the question remains of whether the size of the clinic is adequate. First-Aid Clinic located on-site at the Chambishi Copper Smelter, Zambia  Additionally, the parent company of the SEZ at Chambishi, China's Nonferrous Metals Company (CNMC) has also done something unique among the zones we surveyed: it has opened its own hospital. Located in the nearby town of Kitwe in Zambia's Copperbelt, the Sinozam Friendship Hospital is owned and operated by CNMC, and services are free to all CNMC employees.4 This was the only instance we found of a Chinese overseas SEZ operating its own hospital facilities. While positive for Chambishi's score, this may simply reflect standard practice for Zambia's mining industry; compared to facilities run by non-Chinese multinational firms, some sources suggest Chinese facilities may offer comparatively less care than competing mines.5 More recently in 2018, reports emerged that the Sinozam hospital had been shut down for apparent violations of Zambian law, raising doubts about its own management.6 Sinozam Friendship Hospital Campus, Zambia  The only other zone that we found a hospital within the zone boundary was at Lekki FTZ in Nigeria. Zone management appears to have contracted with a local hospital chain to open a small branch location. St. Nicholas Hospital Clinics branch location in Lekki Free Zone, Nigeria  The results of the rest of our survey showed a lack of strong evidence for on-site dedicated medical facilities. Many zones had local hospitals within a few miles of the zone, but with ambulance service and quality of care uncertain. Education: The prospect of skill transfer and workforce training makes SEZs attractive to host countries.7 Countries like, Cambodia, have direct requirements for zone developers to include vocational training for local workers. However, satellite imagery of our surveyed zones shows few buildings that can be conclusively identified as training facilities. Sihanoukville educational facilities, Cambodia  The smaller training facility in Sihanoukville SEZ was built in 2012 with the help of Wuxi, a Chinese state-run vocational school. The larger facility is the Preah Sihanouk Cambodia-China Friendship Polytechnic Institute. While not pictured, the zone has also partnered with Wuxi to build the Sihanoukville Institute of Business and Technology, where reports promise on-site language and vocational instruction.8 This appears to be the largest instance of zone-backed vocational facilities in our 10 Chinese zones, possibly driven by Sihanoukville's large size and need for skilled workers. Other zones rely more on educational partnerships with external institutions. KITIC near Jakarta is part of a larger industrial zone called GIIC, which directly advertises its partnership with a local vocational school and university and recruits directly.9 Besides vocational education, some zones have pledged to support local non-vocational education. In Zambia, zone operator CNMC lists supporting education as a goal in their report on sustainability, and they have donated materials to help construct a classroom block at Chambishi secondary school. Time-lapse of construction for Chambishi Secondary School, Zambia  Quality of Life: A more contentious aspect of SEZ infrastructure is the provision of worker housing. Proponents for worker housing will argue that since zones often located in distant rural areas where land is plentiful, on-site housing can limit commute time and improve the standard of living.10 Where housing is provided by zones in our subset, it often exists on-site, and sometimes next to restaurants or parks. The most ambitious project is at Khorgos, where a small city has been constructed named Nurkent. Here, free housing is provided to workers supporting both the nearby economic zone and border crossing with China. In the accompanying structured geo-located files, we annotate these possible sites with the label \"orker housing or dormitory.\" Worker Housing: Eastern Industry Zone, Ethiopia (left) and Nurkent at Khorgos, Kazakhstan (right)  Satellite imagery can only illuminate so much: whether or not the buildings interiors are up to code, overcrowded, or used for imported (rather than local) labor is difficult to distinguish from imagery alone. The risk for illicit or illegal activities to be overlooked in worker housing is also a cause for concern.11 Broadly, housing must be accompanied by strong management and policy to ensure workers and investors can benefit. For worker commutes, we can roughly assess road quality to and from the zones, giving us an idea of how well existing local infrastructure can handle SEZ development. Quality of roads servicing around KITIC, Indonesia (above) and Ogun-Guangdong, Nigeria (below)  Among our subset, we rate KITIC highly: it has multi-lane highway leading to the zone, and a highly developed interior set of roads. Others, such as Ogun, have poor or unpaved roads, working their way through local towns and villages before arriving at the nearest major thoroughfare. While this may seem to be a problem for host countries to solve, zones often have a powerful ability to influence their communities in less developed locations. CNMC donated road rehabilitation equipment to a local municipal council and provided funds for a bus shelter and a car park in Kitwe, a large neighbor city to Chambishi. Conclusion Social sustainability cannot be ignored: zones that are better able to support workers are likely to benefit from improved performance and productivity. Across our case subset, zones displayed substantial variation. One area for future exploration is the issue of population displacement for zone development. Locals were displaced during the construction of Ethiopia's Eastern Industry Zone, and years later, local reporting still suggests there is tension between relocated residents and zone developers.12 Relocation of local community during the development of Eastern Industry Zone, Ethiopia  Our preliminary indicators suggest that satellite imagery can offer some insight into social conditions at China-built SEZs, but require substantial context from other open source data and reporting. What zones do with infrastructure matters as much as what they build. For part 3 of this series, we will examine in-depth one influential overseas Chinese SEZ: the China-Zambia Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone. References 1.

Promises from zones for improving social sustainability are particularly vulnerable to behavior that either subverts or ignores these commitments. Incorporating imagery to validate the progress being made in an SEZ is invaluable to holding the tenant companies and zone management accountable. As countries globally look to bolster economic growth by investing in SEZs, either with or without Chinese support, we encourage the proactive use of GEOINT to ensure that promises towards workers and communities are kept.

Article  Timeline  Graphs  North Korea's fishing industry occupies a critical role in the nations economy and social fabric. Its role in the nations economy, particularly its foreign currency earning operations, led to the international prohibition of seafood imports (including fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and other aquatic invertebrates in all forms) from North Korea in UN Security Council Resolution 2371 in August 2017. Socially, while fish represent a primary staple in the diet of both North and South Koreans, for the North it occupies a more critical position having facilitated the populations survival through the tumultuous economic collapse and famines of the 1990s and more recently through wide swings in agricultural production. Since the August 2017 UN sanctions, the U.S. added unilateral sanctions of the North Korean fishing industry on September 21, 2017 through 13810 Executive Order. On December 22, 2017, the UN Security Council passed resolution 2397, further clarifying the sanctions also prohibit North Korea from selling or transferring, directly or indirectly, fishing rights. The U.S. then added its own unilateral actions prohibiting the purchase of fishing rights from North Korea on January 3, 2017 with the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), PL 115-44. Enforcement of these international sanctions on North Korean seafood should be expected, therefore, to have an impact on both North Korea's baseline fisheries earnings and the expected future return on the regime's investment of resources and strategic effort to modernize its fishing industry. International sanctions come in the midst of a far-reaching strategic effort to develop North Korea's fishing industry, an effort most recently reinforced in North Korea's summer 2017 Cabinet Plenum meeting. The meetings directed the Ministry of Fisheries to expand existing modernization plans for the nations fishing infrastructure. Along with directions to fulfill existing fishing vessel production and construction of a loach production base, the ministry was directed to undertake a number of projects on the east coast. While these projects did not include Fishery Station No. 15, which is under the KPA, they included the modernization of the Sinpo Canned Fish Plant and construction of a general fishing tackle production base on the east coast.1 Fishery operations in North Korea are administered under two parallel but separate organizational structures by the Ministry of Fisheries and certain units of the KPA. The KPA operates a series of fishery stations that reportedly provide fish for the KPA, residents in the capital city of Pyongyang and, more significantly, for international sale and foreign currency earning operations. Among the more frequently mentioned KPA fishery stations mentioned in the North Korean media during the past five years are:2 Fishery Station No. 18 (Wonsan-si), under KPA Unit No. 5673 Fishery Station No. 15 (Namsong-ni), under KPA No. Unit 549 Raksan Offshore Salmon Fish Farm, under KPA No. Unit 810 August 25 Fishery Station (Tongchon-up), under KPA Unit No. 313 January 8 Fishery Station, under KPA Unit No. 534 May 27 Fishery Station, under KPA No. Unit 534. Ministry of Fisheries control extends down through Provincial Fishery Management Bureaus to large fishery stations (i.e., Nampho [Nampo] Fishery Station, Kimchaek Fishery Station, etc.), Distant-Sea Fishery Complexes and small local fishing concerns (i.e., small-scale fishing stations) along both coasts and inland lakes and rivers.4 The Ministry of Fisheries also operates a number of national level bureaus (e.g., Fish Farming Management, etc.), laboratories, and institutes (e.g., Institute of Fishery, etc.) to support the industry.5 It apparently also operates, or oversees operations at, an unknown number of fishing boat construction and repair facilities (some of which are associated with provincial fishing stations).6 The KPA has always operated a second economy in parallel with the domestic economy. Reforms that started with events of the 1990s have continued to evolve since Kim Jong-un assumed power and the KPA has devoted a greater effort than it had historically to food production and foreign currency earning. Kim Jong-un also taken a more proactive role in both praising and criticizing economic projects. The level of praise Kim has specifically granted to the KPA's fisheries has been notable and evidenced by the number of visits and on-the-spot guidance trips taken by Kim and other high-level KPA and Worker Party of Korea (WPK) officials reported by state media.7 Annual worker ceremonies also celebrate the achievements of the so-called activists in fisheries under the KPA. These annual events appear to have reached new heights in 2013 and were reported in 2014,8 2015,9 and 201610 to applaud fulfillment of fishery production goals. Fishery Station No. 15 Since 2015, a new and significant modernization and expansion project has been underway at Fishery Station No. 15 on North Korea's east coast, 8.7 km east of the port city of Wonsan-si, in the village of Namsong-ni, Anbyon-gun, Kangwon-do. The fishery, operated under KPA Unit No. 549, was reportedly inaugurated in 1972. However, a declassified satellite image acquired on December 8, 1974 of Namsong-ni shows elements of a tiny village but no indication of any significant fishing activity. If the 1972 date is correct, then Fishery Station No. 15 may have been located elsewhere potentially in Wonsan at that time. An overview of the Namsong-ni area showing no indications of significant fishing activity. (CIA, Declassified KH-7 image from KH-7 mission 1207, December 8, 1974).  Little open source information is readily available concerning the stations development or operations prior to 2015, except that Kim Jong-il had once visited it. Satellite imagery from 2002-2014, however, provides some insight. By 2002, the village of Namsong-ni had grown considerably and Fishery Station No. 15 was well established. Satellite imagery generally available in Google Earth shows during the next 13 years the station was generally active with fluctuating numbers of fishing vessels present and minor infrastructure changes typical of what would be expected to be seen along the coasts of North Korea. The facility encompassed approximately 10 hectares and consisted of approximately 24-26 buildings (split between a main facility and what appears to be a small support compound 100 meters to the northeast), a 165-meter-long wharf, the partial remains of an old pier to the northeast, and a rudimentary shipyard and single repair way for fishing vessels. A crude 55-meter-long pier, immediately to the west of the facility was present in 2002 but was razed sometime in 2012. In 2014, a minor renovation took place at the station during which a new building was erected, three buildings had new roofs installed, the yards and wharf were resurfaced, and decking was placed on the old pier to the northeast allowing for regular light use. Satellite imagery from April 24, 2015, prior to Kim Jong-uns first visit, shows the facility as it looked before the start of the subsequent multi-year modernization and expansion program. The station encompassed approximately 10 hectares with approximately 32 buildings. Although it is not definitively known, it is likely that Fishery Station No. 15 and other KPA fishery stations began benefiting during 2015 from ongoing research being conducted by elements of the Ministry of Fisheries into establishing a system to support a fishing ground search using satellite information.11 This system may be what is later identified as the \"maritime environment information analysis and assessment system.\"12 Exactly which satellites this system uses is unknown, however, there are a number of free international satellite repositories that would be beneficial for this type of work. Such a system was apparently in use the following year when it was reported that, \"Water temperature transmission system based on satellite information, system for detecting fishing ground and a program for estimating hard-finned sandfish fishery have been introduced into fishery stations and fishing boats under the Ministry of Fisheries.\"13 Modernization and Expansion of Fishery Station No. 15 On November 24, 2015, two days after a trip to the August 25 Fishery Station under KPA Unit 313, Kim Jong-un undertook a field guidance trip to Fishery Station No. 15 under KPA Unit 549.14 Here he congratulated the officials and employees of the station for making a big haul to satisfy the Supreme Commanders desire to supply fishes to the service persons every day and supplying fresh fishes to the soldiers in all seasons. Kim's visit to the station was, reportedly, not only to congratulate it on its achievements but also to provide a fresh turning point in the work of the station. This fresh turning point initiated a sweeping multi-year modernization and expansion program. Among the areas to be addressed under this program were: construction of a new breakwater and wharf; introduction of new fishing and processing technology onshore and on the stations fishing vessels; expansion of the flash-freezing and refrigerating facilities; expansion of mechanization in unloading, sorting, freezing, and storage operations; improved maintenance and repair of fishing vessels; modernization of all production buildings; and improved housing and leisure facilities for members and their families. While outside technical assistance would be forthcoming, much of the physical labor would be undertaken by the officials and employees of the station with assistance from Unit No. 549. The ultimate goals of these projects were to enable it to catch, process, and deliver a greater tonnage of processed fish in fulfillment of newly established goals.

Although this drawing does not show the small compound and old pier to the northeast, satellite imagery clearly shows their use by the fishery station, (Rodong Sinmun, November 25, 2015).  Kim Jong-un walking along the original wharf at Fishery Station No. 15 prior to its expansion (Rodong Sinmun, November 25, 2015).  Satellite imagery indicates that the modernization program began quickly shortly after Kim's visit. By March 23, 2016, many of the stations existing buildings had been razed and excavations for the foundations for the new processing plant and other buildings were being excavated. Work had also begun on expanding and modernizing the main wharf. By August 17, 2016, the station had expanded to encompass approximately 14 hectares due to the arrival of hundreds of concrete caissons, blocks and tetrapods for expansion and construction of wharfs, and a seawall. The new processing plant, shipyard with repair shops and storerooms,15 and approximately nine other buildings were externally completed. Several monuments had also been erected. However, several other buildings were still under construction and the stations roads and parking areas had yet to be graded and paved. Approximately 34 buildings were completed or under construction and numerous construction vehicles were present throughout the station. Large fishing vessels were present along the northeast pier, main wharf and on the repair way. At the end of the following month, several additional buildings were externally complete, and work was slowly proceeding on the main wharf. On February 26, 2016, a total of 12 large fishing vessels were present along the northeast pier, main wharf and outside the repair way. This has been the largest number observed at any one time at the station and was likely related to the impending start of the years first 70-day campaign to greet the historic Seventh Congress of the Workers Party of Korea with unprecedented labor achievements.16 On December 14, 2016, a year after his first visit, Kim Jong-un returned to the Fishery Station No. 15 for a second On-the-Spot-Guidance inspection both to congratulate the unit on fulfilling the annual fishing plan 170 percent and to assess progress with the modernization program.17 During his visit, Kim inspected the stations production facilities and fishing vessels, was briefed on the modernization and expansion programs progress, and emphasized the importance of transforming the station by the informatization and the scientization [sic] of production and business activities to bring it into the era of [a] knowledge-based economy.18 Once again, he set annual fish production goals for the station and stated that his father, Kim Jong-il, would be pleased if the fish caught by the peoples army were sent to the citizens of the capital city.19 (As of August 2018, Kim is not reported to have revisited Fishery Station No. 15.) Kim Jong-un in front of the Daanpoong No. 5 (Autumn Foliage No. 5) fishing boat of Fishery Station No. 15 (Rodong Sinmun, December 15, 2016).20  Satellite imagery from March 28, 2017, shows that steady progress had been made on the main station facilities. There were now approximately 29 buildings, construction of a new greenhouse had begun, the roads and parking areas had been graded and paved, the main wharf had been expanded to 240-meters-long, and nine large fishing vessels were present. By November 4, 2017, the infrastructure of the main facility (including the new greenhouse) was complete, the main wharf had been extended to its final length of 325-meters, a new 60-meter-long jetty had been built to the west of the station, and construction of a long seawall had started. At the northeast pier, an 18-meter-long concrete and earth ramp was built out over the old framework. No large fishing vessels were present. The following year would witness continuing development and expansion of Fishery Station No. 15. By January 20, 2018, work had progressed to lengthen the jetty to approximately 75-meters-long, seawall construction continued slowly, and the concrete and earth ramp at the northeast pier had been extended to 40-meters-long. Ten large fishing vessels were present. Five months later, on June 6, 2018, dramatic changes had occurred. With work on the main station infrastructure completed construction moved into a second phase focused on adding new infrastructure and housing. A new wharf was under construction 200 meters west of the station and was now 125-meters-long and work continued on a seawall, that will eventually be at least 300-meters-long. Immediately behind the new wharf and seawall, a large area had been cleared and graded, and construction of several new buildings begun. Five large fishing vessels were present. Within the village of Namsong-ni, all the dwellings with a large 5.5-hectare area immediately south of the station had been razed and 29 new housing units (potentially apartment buildings) were under construction.21 As of July 26, 2018, Fishery Station No. 15 had expanded to encompass approximately 22.5-hectares, construction had continued on both the new wharf, which was now 175-meters-long, and the seawall. The jetty that had been erected during 2017 was removed, the seawall has been widened and extended, and the area immediately behind has continued to be developed. Work continues on the new wharf, which will likely continue to be extended to create a protected boat basin. Six large fishing vessels are present (two of which are on the repair way). Within the village of Namsong-ni, construction on the new housing units slowly continued and most foundations and first-floor walls have been completed. Satellite imagery clearly indicates that the development of Fishery Station No. 15 is scheduled to continue for the remainder of 2018 and potentially into 2019. Production and Operations North Korean media reports indicate that Fishery Station No. 15 facilities includes:22 pickling tanks; freezing storehouses; processing shop with an automated conveyor belt and robotization at a high level; a combined control room with maritime environment information analysis and assessment system, maritime command system, processing equipment control system, and electric power monitoring system; revolutionary history education room, history introduction room, the cultural hall, science and technology dissemination room, and a medical center; and employee housing. North Korean media reports indicate Fishery Station No. 15 produces pickled and frozen seafood products. Open-source reports are not available on the precise types of fish caught and processed by Fishery Station No. 15. However, seafood commonly caught off North Korea's east coast include cod, Japanese amberjack (yellowtail), Alaskan pollock, assorted varieties of mackerel, Japanese sandfish, herring, anchovy, sardine, Pacific saury, red snow crab, and flounder.23 Pickling tanks at Fishery Station No. 15 with salt pile on right (Rodong Sinmun, November 25, 2015).  Kim Jong-un in a freezer surrounded by blocks of frozen fish (Rodong Sinmun, November 25, 2015).  North Korean media reports fishing methods utilized by the KPA and Ministry of Fisheries include gill-net, cage-net fish farming, purse, set-net, and trawling. KPA operations are conducted collectively or separately with small or large boats in distant or nearby seas.24 North Korean fishing industry's critical role in the nations economy, particularly its foreign currency earning operations, led to a series of recent international sanctions starting with an August 2017 UN Security Council prohibition of North Korean seafood imports. Concurrently, since 2015, a significant modernization and expansion project has been underway at the Korean Peoples Army (KPA) Fishery Station No. 15 on North Korea's east coast. Satellite imagery clearly indicates the development of Fishery Station No. 15, a multi-year modernization and expansion project, which is scheduled to continue for the remainder of 2018 and potentially into 2019. While the data is incomplete, some preliminary insights into its operations may be derived by reviewing the number of large fishing vessels (25-30 meter-long) present in satellite imagery at Fishery Station No. 15. The highest number of large shipping vessels present appears to be at the beginning of a fishing campaign (i.e., season). With the exception of the period when the stations shipyard was being rebuilt, there have been an average of 1.2 larger fishing vessels on the repair ways. This indicates either a proactive program of maintenance and repair, or a low-level of preventive maintenance. Of the dates available for analysis, the fewest number of large fishing vessels were observed on November 3 and 4, 2017, recording 1 and 0 vessels respectively. This was apparently due to the end of the winter fishing season and the effort to fulfill or exceed catch and production quotas.25 The high number (average of 7.2) large fishing vessels present on almost every date observed may suggest a low supply of fuel, a pattern of only sending the fleet out as a group (for security and efficiency), or some other factor. These numbers may be skewed by the possible introduction of additional fishing vessels or the loan of vessels from other fishery stations. Fishing Vessels Present at Fishery Station No. 15 26 The activity observed at Fishery Station No. 15 over the past three years probably indicates this project is more than a basic modernization and expansion of a single fishery station. Rather it may be a component of a far-reaching strategic effort to develop North Korea's fishing industry, an effort recently reinforced by declarations from the summer 2017 Cabinet Plenum. Enforcement of international sanctions on North Korean seafood should be expected, therefore, to have an impact on both North Korea's baseline fisheries earnings and the expected future return on the regime's investment of resources and strategic effort in this modernization project.

Source: \n See Enlarged Compare Slider  Looking Ahead The degree to which international sanctions on North Korean seafood and sale of fishing rights are enforced will largely determine the impact such a regime can be expected to have on North Korea's fishing industry. Should news reports of relaxed sanctions enforcement or of an uptick of fish transfers at sea increase, the North Korean fishing industry, including the KPA's Fishing Station No. 15, will see a reduced impact on their foreign currency earning capabilities. Looking ahead for the status of the ongoing modernization and expansion projects, any one of, or any combination thereof, the following would indicate a strategic decision to further develop the fishery station. This would likely be a continuation, or expansion, of the existing national level fishery expansion plan that was instituted several years ago by Kim Jong-un.  Things To Watch Completion of the sea wall and construction of additional piers or wharfs. Expansion of the open area behind the sea wall and the construction of new processing facilities here. Construction of additional housing units in the village of Naming-ni. Presence of additional large fishing vessels or the construction of such vessels at the No. 15 Fishery Station.

{"article":"Environmental Effect of Coal Mine Deterioration in Eastern Ukraine.json","text":"Ukraine  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Environmental Effect of Coal Mine Deterioration in Eastern Ukraine  In partnership with \n College of William & Mary \n and written by \n Daniella Marx, \n Caroline Morin, \n Cole Spiller, \n Yasha Barth, \n Aliia Woodworth, \n Catherine Cable, \n and Carolina Rivera  Latest Conflict in Donbas Accelerating Mine Deterioration Impact Negative Environmental Impact Published May 20 2022 7\u00a0months, 3\u00a0weeks Go to map  Overview  The Donbas has historically been the industrial heartland of Ukraine, serving as a center for industry and coal mining. The war in eastern Ukraine that began in 2014 led to the destruction of many forms of critical infrastructure and prohibited the maintenance of hundreds of coal mines. Destruction of this infrastructure has not only disrupted life in the region, but also set the stage for potential ecological damage. The Russian invasion that began on 24 February 2022, will only worsen the current situation as intensified conflict will continue to damage and prevent the maintenance of hundreds of coal mines throughout the Donbas. The repair and maintenance of these mines will be a primary area of concern for whichever entity holds postwar control over the territory. Activity Recent GEOINT analysis from 2020-2022 shows noteworthy surface water pollution near deteriorating mines in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, a phenomenon which will have repercussions in the postwar Donbas. Article  Timeline  Graphs  Background Information Since 2014, the Donbas has endured active armed hostilities between the Ukrainian government and the Russian-backed separatist states of the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) and Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), which have jeopardized mining operations in the region. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe estimates that 36 mines out of the 88 mines controlled by separatists have been reported outright destroyed or flooded due to the conflict. While the conflict in the Donbas from 2014-2022 was characterized by relatively low-intensity fighting, the Russian invasion which began on 24 February 2022 has drastically escalated the fighting in the region. After the Russian announcement of a renewed focus on military operations in the Donbas, continued maintenance will be difficult and it is very likely the conditions of these coal mines in the Donbas will continue to deteriorate. Map of all of the mines found and assessed by our team in the Donbas. Mines are denoted by green symbols, case studies are denoted by yellow symbols. Lines of contact from the 2014-2022 conflict demonstrate the de facto borders between the Ukrainian government and the Russian-backed separatist republics. As of 13 May 2022, much of the Luhansk oblast is under control of Russian forces. Primary advances by Russian forces between 24 February and 13 May are denoted on the map.  The coal mining industry in the Donbas region of Ukraine dates back to the 18th century, and in the 20th century, the Donbas became a focal point for supplying the Soviet Union with coal and energy. While the importance of Donbas coal to the Ukrainian and Russian economies has decreased over the past few decades, the region is still home to immense high-quality coal reserves. However, since 1986, Russia has reduced its reliance on Donbas coal mines due to poor living standards in the region and the technology investments needed to maintain the mines. Many mines are now too deep (20% of mines are deeper than 1000-1400m) or are considered unstable or hazardous due to poor geological conditions. Despite the decrease in Russia's reliance on Donbas coal over time, pre-existing Donbas mines offer Russia an option to increase their coal extraction in the future. Should Russia establish long-term control or influence over the Donbas, these plentiful coal reserves could be controlled by Moscow's proxies or even integrated into the Russian Federation. Over the course of the conflict in the Donbas from 2014-2022, the Russian-backed separatist states of the LPR and DPR controlled 88 out of 121 active mines in the Donbas according to the Ukrainian government. Of these 88 mines, 36 have been reported outright destroyed or flooded due to the conflict. Despite the lack of ongoing mining operations in these destroyed or inactive mines, continual upkeep is still required to prevent the mines from deteriorating and polluting local environments. It has become clear that separatist authorities have failed to properly manage these mines. In 2018, excess groundwater from separatist-controlled mines reportedly began flooding neighboring mines. These flooded mines have destabilizing effects on the overall Donbas region, including gas explosions, ground tremors, and even the toxification of drinking water. \u200b\u200bGeneral Environmental Consequences of Flooded Mines The flooding of inactive coal mines in eastern Ukraine can create environmental consequences for the entire Donbas ecosystem. According to an on-the-ground report conducted by the Truth Hounds with the National Endowment for Democracy, the most reported environmental consequences of flooded mines on the surrounding infrastructure include: The pollution of ground and surface water (in some cases radioactive contamination) from toxic chemical byproducts of coal mining that leaches into surrounding rivers, and in some cases, a region's main source of drinking water. Groundwater pollution takes two primary forms: Toxic chemical pollution: the presence of numerous excess pollutants derived from the mining process, such as chlorides, sulfates, iron, manganese, and nickel. Visibly detectable by an orange-brown discoloration on imagery. Eutrophication: the presence of excess nitrogen and phosphates also derived from the mining process. A common visible effect of eutrophication is algal blooms, where algae rapidly grows due to the excess nitrogen and phosphorus in the water. Visibly detectable by an overly green discoloration on imagery. Toxic gas leakages with potential health consequences on the surrounding populations. Increase in groundwater levels by subsidence of soil, risking \"man-made earthquakes\" that result in tremors and cracks in the surface. Residential buildings are most vulnerable to facing costly damage. An estimated 12,000 hectares\/29,000 acres are facing the risk of subsidence. The deterioration of soil quality affects the surrounding agricultural zones. Air pollution from liquid chlorine carbon monoxide, sulfur oxide, and other toxic substances. Both the collapse of infrastructure that would flush water from mines and the flooding of mines pose threats to potable water and accessibility for the people of the region. Annual drainage of mines across eastern Ukraine has been halved since 2014. In eastern Ukraine, this means more than 800 million cubic meters of water (which in the past would have been considered wastewater and properly flushed out) is being absorbed into underground aquifers, causing salinization and polluting water sources with toxic chemicals. The build-up of water in these abandoned mine cavities also pushes methane and radon gasses towards the surface. Effects of this can be as minor as land convexity and as major as triggering explosions in basements of buildings. As the conflict continues in eastern Ukraine, the possibility of shelling or other kinetic acts could trigger minor explosions as it interacts with the volatile radon and methane gasses. Environmental degradation such as water pollution has negatively affected the people of the Donbas and will continue to so long as the current crisis prevents adequate maintenance of mines throughout the Donbas. Before the February 2022 invasion, around 1.65 million people in eastern Ukraine were in need of water-related assistance, be it by water stoppages, shortages, or lack of access to potable water. As more critical mining infrastructure is destroyed or neglected due to continued conflict, more citizens will lose access to critical resources such as potable water. While the fate of the Donbas is yet to be determined, whichever government controls the region at the end of the current conflict will have to act quickly to address these issues and avert environmental damage. Key Findings These case studies are examples of trends seen across deteriorating mines in the Donbas. The conflict from 2014-2022 and now the Russian invasion of 24 February 2022 will only exacerbate the negative conditions of mines across the Donbas. Yunkom Mine - Surface Water Pollution and Potential for Radiological Contamination Commercial and open satellite imagery analysis of the Yunkom mine demonstrates significant pollution of nearby surface water reservoirs. The mine has also been a site for radiological waste disposal, which compounds its environmental toll. Controlled by separatist forces since 2014, analysis has determined little has been done to prevent flooding and pollution. \"5-6\" Mine - Flooded Mine which Correlates with Polluted Surface Water Commercial and open satellite imagery analysis of the \"5-6\" mine demonstrates significant nitrate pollution of multiple surface water reservoirs. Although located over 40 kilometers from the conflict zone, the mine still fell into disrepair and has been polluting the local environment. Zolote-Rodina - Preventative Maintenance Commercial and open satellite imagery analysis of the Zolote and Rodina mines demonstrates controlled and managed surface water pollution, likely attributed to renewed maintenance of the mine in 2018. The mine is located within a kilometer of the 2014-2022 line of contact and may serve as an examplar for future management of flooded mines near and around the conflict area. Methodology This study utilized commercial satellite imagery and GIS datasets to create and analyze a comprehensive dataset of coal mines within the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine. Satellite imagery of mining areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts were analyzed with Maxar commercial imagery and public layers in Google Earth Pro. Coal mines were identified by the presence of large coal tailings (large material piles), open-source information compiled from on-the-ground reporting and OpenStreetMap. The imagery analysis was supplemented with press reports, scientific papers, and government documentation. Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (HDCI) Our analysis was supplemented further by using the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) to identify polluted bodies of water. The NDCI is an index that aims to predict plant chlorophyll (the natural green compound that gives plants their color) content. By using color coding and imagery from Sentinel-2 satellites, the index is able to estimate eutrophication and other forms of pollution. Eutrophication is defined as the excessive richness of nutrients in a lake or other body of water, frequently due to runoff from the land, which causes a dense growth of plant life and death of animal life from lack of oxygen. While only a computer-generated estimation, the index helped down-select which bodies of water to investigate further. The data accompanying this article (downloadable as a SV and MZ file) lists the locations and attributes of over 300 mines. Mine names were derived from OpenStreetMap, and unnamed mines were named numerically by oblast. Due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, many official resources and datasets such as the Donbas Environmental Information System are unavailable. Therefore this dataset is not an official tally of all of the coal mines in Donbas, but rather a comprehensive assessment of most of the mines in the region discovered by our team. The nvironmental Scorecard was created to illustrate the potential risk factors associated with each of the 300 + mines analyzed by our team. Each mine was examined for three key factors that could impact the pollution potential, namely proximity to population centers, conflict areas, and significant surface water sources. Proximity to population was determined by each mine's relative distance to population centers. A mine was considered proximal to conflict if it was located within 10 kilometers of the 2014-2022 line of contact or if located to the west of the line of contact, as current Russian offensives are advancing westward. Proximity to water was determined by using a 1500-meter proximity to waterways and surface water reservoirs. 1500 meters was considered a significant distance as previous studies in the region have documented surface water pollution detectable by up to 1500 meters from polluted mines in the Donbas. Case Studies 1: Yunkom Mine Satellite imagery analysis of the Yunkom mine demonstrates significant chemical pollution of nearby surface water reservoirs. The mine has also been a site for radiological waste disposal, which compounds its environmental toll. Controlled by separatist forces since 2014, satellite imagery analysis has determined little has been done to prevent flooding and pollution. Located in the separatist-controlled Donbas, the Yunkom mine was the site of a controlled atomic explosion in 1979. In order to limit the explosion's long-term impact, its radioactive by-products were sealed within a chamber deep in the mine. This solution was not effective for long. As early as 1991, inspectors discovered cracks in the Yunkom radioactive chamber. These fissures increase the likelihood of radionuclide migration, which poses a human and ecological threat to the region. The escalation of conflict and shelling in the region have further burdened efforts to retain any form of administrative control over the mine. Figure 1B: In March 2020, radionuclides likely originating from Yunkom were found at multiple points up to five kilometers away from the mine. This area cover numerous bodies of nearby surface water and the Bulavynka tributary, which flows into the nearby Kyrnka river and then eventually into the Mius river. These rivers flow hundreds of miles through the Donbas and southern Russia.  The presence of radionuclides prompts concerns regarding human wellbeing. Radionuclides are radioactive forms of elements that are the byproduct of nuclear reactions. These radioactive elements are slowly decaying, this decay can take anywhere from mere seconds to millions of years. While the radionuclides cannot be observed on imagery, Figure 1B depicts the mine's proximity to Yunkomunarivs'k (large urban center) and local water sources. Based on the several locations reporting the presence of radionuclides, citizens in Yunokunarivsk and others in the region may have been exposed through local water supplies. If left unchanged, these radionuclides could penetrate into the local Bulavynka and Kyrnka rivers, which connect to the Mius river and flow into the Black Sea. Groundwater pollution could even penetrate into the Siversky-Donetsk river, which supplies nearly 85% of water provided in the greater region, according to on-the-ground investigations by Truth Hounds and the National Endowment for Democracy. Wider contamination would not only affect the eastern Ukrainian population, but also the entirety of the DPR, LPR, and even sizeable Russian cities near the border, such as Rostov. Figure 1C: Image of the Yunkom mine and surrounding area. While the blue-green water directly next to Yunkom mine and Yunkomunarvis'k do not show signs of traditional pollutants, studies from the area have discovered the presence of low-level radionuclides. Numerous water sources to the north of the mine and Yunkomunarvis'k which show signs of surface water pollution evident by orange-brown discoloration in ponds.  We assess that it is probable that both nuclear and nonnuclear contamination is spreading from the Yunkom mine. The bodies of discolored water in Figure 1C demonstrate the visible extent of nonnuclear contaminants as of September 2020, and reporting indicates that the pollution has worsened. Although radionuclides five kilometers from Yunkom were detected in 2020 (Figure 1B), no further effort has been made by the separatist authorities to maintain the mine, meaning it could be likely that radionuclides are spreading throughout the groundwater based on Truth Hound and National Endowment for Democracy reporting. Although the full extent of pollution from the mine cannot be ascertained by our analysis, further pollution and contamination of the direct area and into the Siversky-Donetsk river is a possibility. It is clear that without the necessary resources, this mine could continue to pose a unique and critical threat across the Donbas. 2: \"5-6\" Mine in Myrnograd (formerly known as Dimitrov) Satellite imagery analysis of the \"5-6\" mine demonstrates significant nitrate pollution of multiple surface water reservoirs. Although located over 40 kilometers from the conflict zone, the mine still fell into disrepair and has been polluting the local environment. The 5-6 mine is under the authority of the state-owned enterprise, Mirnogradugol, in the city of Myrnograd of the Donetsk Oblast. The mine is located within Ukrainian government-controlled territory, 40 kilometers from the 2014-2022 line of contact. Although significantly behind the frontline, the threat of heavy military conflict has greatly reduced the activity of the mine (the intense 2014-2015 battle for the Donetsk Airport was an hour away from Myrnograd). According to the official website of the 5-6 Mine, the mine has been operating irregularly due to insufficient funding. Prior to the conflict, the mine was known in the region for its high production with an annual capacity producing 900 thousand tons. However, production has greatly declined since the onset of hostilities in 2014 with the most recent annual production capacity reaching only 135 thousand tons. Figure 2A: The area around the 5-6 mine contains numerous bodies of water, labelled A-G. All the points in the following figure refer to the bodies of water connected to the Kazenyi Torets river, which connects to the Siversky-Donetsk river, the primary river for the area.  The mining process has remained irregular during the conflict in the Donbas and the site has not been well-maintained. The area around the 5-6 mine contains numerous bodies of water, labeled points A-G in Figures 2A and 2B. After performing the NDCI analysis illustrated in figure 2B, points D, E, F and G appear to be polluted indicated by the orange and red pixels. Follow-up visual analysis shows a greener hue in these bodies of water, indicating eutrophication due to higher nitrate concentration - the release of which is a byproduct of excavating coal mines. Figure 2B: NDCI analysis shows points D, E, F and G have water pollution indicated with orange and red pixels. Reports from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) have corroborated that higher levels of nitrates and copper (byproducts of coal mining in the region) have been found in these bodies of water. It is unclear as to why bodies of water A, B, and C are less polluted. These points span primarily over the Kazenyi Torets river, where a 2017 report by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) corroborated this analysis by noting increased concentrations of nitrates and copper. A high concentration of oil-based products was also found within the Kazenyi river, which can further be verified by the findings in this OSCE report and the pollution index (in points D, E, F, and G). It is unclear why the surface waters present in bodies A, B, and C are unpolluted. The 5-6 mine shaft leads to the Sinna Beam, a ravine that further connects to the Kazenny Torets River. The cities of Druzhovka (population of 55,088), Kramatorsk (population of 150,084), and Slavyansk (population of 106,972) are located on the river basin of the Kazenyi Torets River. The Kazenyi Torets connects to the Siversky-Donetsk river, the primary river throughout the Donbas. If pollution continues to build from the 5-6 mine and flow into the Siversky-Donetsk, the Donbas could be at risk for contamination. 3: Zolote and Rodina Linked Mines Many mines, such as the Zolote and Rodina mines, in the region are linked underground and therefore the environmental consequences from one damaged mine can affect other nearby mines. Satellite imagery analysis of the Zolote and Rodina mines demonstrates managed surface water pollution, likely attributed to renewed maintenance of the mine in 2018. The mine is located within a kilometer of the 2014-2022 line of contact and may serve as an exemplar for future successful management of flooded mines near and around the conflict area. The mines located in Zolote in the Luhansk oblast are interconnected to support one another: the Rodina, Pervomaiska, and Holubivska mines operate to restrict the flow of mine water to the operational mines of Hirska, Karbonit, and Zolote. The underground links between these mines mean that any amount of untreated water can spread rapidly, spreading pollution throughout all of the linked mines and widening the area affected by the pollutants. Figure 3A: The Zolote and Rodina mines, which are hydrologically connected underground, are also both adjacent to the Komyshuvakha tributary. The mines are located under two kilometers from the line of contact in 2014-2022 with Ukrainian military positions visible just south of the mines. Reporting indicates that nearby population centers have been evacuated for years since the outbreak of the conflict.  Figure 3B: A small pond located directly adjacent to the Zolote mine has an orange discoloration caused by contamination by toxic mining chemicals. The nearby tributary and surface water sources remain visibly unpolluted however.  Since the Russian invasion that began in February 2022, the area around Zolote has been the focus of a renewed Russian offensive to take military control over the entire Donbas. As of 14 May 2022, the Russian military is reported to control the town of Zolote. As these mines are in an active war zone, local bombing and shelling will prohibit the safe maintenance of these mines. Continual investment in machinery to pump water and control flood levels at the Zolote and Rodina mines appeared to be working from 2017 to 2020, effectively maintaining safer water quality for nearby towns and surrounding farmland. While promising, the current conflict has likely halted maintenance of the project and is a cause for concern. Conclusion The February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has the potential to exacerbate the deterioration of the hundreds of coal mines throughout eastern Ukraine. Active and expanded hostilities will make it difficult for maintenance projects to continue. Satellite imagery analysis has provided useful insights into the possible extent of pollution and moderately managed cases from various mines across the Donbas. The presence of toxic pollutants in surface water has been detected throughout the Donbas as illustrated by the Yunkom and 5-6 mine case studies. While not as environmentally dangerous as toxic chemical pollution, eutrophication indicating nitrate pollution has also been observed around many mines as indicated by the analysis of the 5-6 mine. Radionuclide pollution from the Yunkom mine, while currently a low-level risk, could scale to greater environmental damage if left unaddressed. The conflict of 2014-2022 made maintenance difficult, not impossible. While the separatist states have done little to maintain critical mines in the region like Yunkom, efforts by the Ukrainian government to maintain mines and prevent flooding, even close to the conflict zone in Zolote, were met with moderate success. The situation in the Donbas will only continue to deteriorate as long as the conflict in the region continues. The potential contamination of the Siversky-Donetsk river basin by both toxic pollutants and even possibly radionuclides could set the entire Donbas region on a course for ecological distress. While the outcome of the current conflict is uncertain, whatever power that holds control over the Donbas will have to act quickly to address the deterioration of these mines.

{"article":"Part 2_ Evaluating Chinas Tree-Planting Activity.json","text":"Climate Change  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Part 2: Evaluating China's Tree-Planting Activity  In partnership with \n Columbia University \n and written by \n Capstone Team, Class of 2021  Latest Tree-planting goals post-COVID Impact Gaps between Chinese gov't data and green analysis Published Sep 16 2021 1\u00a0year, 3\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  In September 2020, against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic and with the global economy still reeling, China pledged that it would achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. In this two-part series, researchers from the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs explore China's progress towards that goal along two vectors: \"brown\" and \"green.\" Part 2 (\"green\") examines how tree cover has changed in two provinces as China conducts major tree-planting efforts. Activity Analysis of electro-optical satellite imagery, open satellite radar data, ground photography, and online literature illustrates an apparent discrepancy between official Chinese efforts on tree planting versus on-the-ground progress. Article  Timeline  Throughout 2020, China highlighted its plans to promote environmentally sustainable growth. At the end of 2020, China's President Xi Jinping went before the United Nations and encouraged a green recovery from the pandemic, while in December, he committed China to meet a series of environmental targets--peaking CO2 emissions, increasing the renewable energy share to 25%, and increasing China's forest stock by 6 billion cubic meters from 2005 levels--by 2030. This last target--increasing forest cover--saw China continue tree-planting programs throughout 2020 in spite of the pandemic. With some municipalities still under lockdown, official press releases assured that China and Xi Jinping would forge ahead on environmental efforts, and in Jiangxi and Hebei provinces, workers who were unable to travel home due to lockdowns were even re-tasked with planting trees. China's afforestation and reforestation efforts date back to the 1970s when Deng Xiaoping--reversing Mao-era development policies that devastated Chinese forests--implemented tree-planting programs that still run today. One of the largest and most widely publicized is the Green Great Wall program. Originally designed to halt soil erosion and desertification in Northern China, the massive project covers a perimeter of 400km and will not end until 2050. Another major program is the Grain to Green Program, which pays farmers to plant trees in most of China's provinces. Officially, China's progress under these programs (and others) has been substantial. Since 2000, official data indicates China planted 88.9 million hectares of trees, representing an area larger than France, and increased the country's forested area by almost 5%. If anything, China's new planting targets are even more ambitious, aiming to increase forested areas further 1% by 2025. These new trees are now part of China's overall climate targets and the latest (Fourteenth) Five-Year Plan. These developments gave global environmentalists some grounds for optimism. Yet there are also grounds for skepticism. Progress in one aspect of China's environment can be undermined by backsliding or stagnation in other aspects; we examined this dynamic in Article 1, as we outlined how China continued to rapidly approve and construct new power plants in 2020. Whether or not China will be able to meet these targets is an open question, but past tree-planting efforts--evaluated through the use of remote sensing data--provide some crucial context. Data from two provinces show possible discrepancies between China's past stated performance and conditions on the ground, and highlight some of the challenges China will face in moving forward on its environmental goals when the pandemic subsides. Analyzing plant cover Satellite remote sensing data can help clarify whether official statistics are matched by increased greening on the ground. We analyze satellite data to calculate Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values, which indicate the presence and density of live vegetation in a given area. Although the NDVI alone cannot explain why changes in vegetation cover happen--whether due to natural growth or human intervention--changes in the NDVI over time provide strong evidence of whether an area is growing greener or browner over time. We compared NDVI results to Chinese afforestation statistics, in particular, the total area of afforestation claimed for each province in China's annual Statistical Yearbooks. If forest planting is taking place in a given area, significant greening should be visible in two to three years as China predominantly plants rapid growth trees such as poplars and Chinese firs. Moreover, as newly planted saplings mature, their growth should register as changes in the NDVI. We focused specifically on tree-planting efforts in two provinces, with different climatic zones: Inner Mongolia, a large and mostly arid area in the North that comprises a significant portion of the Green Great Wall; and Jiangxi, a province in the South, in a more humid zone, where the \"Grain to Green Program\" is active. The Grain to Green program, initiated in 1999, pays farmers to plant trees and convert farmland to forest, providing subsidies for seeds and other inputs. We deployed open-source imagery and remote sensing data analyzed through Google Earth Engine. First, to get a general sense of changes over time, we utilize daily NDVI data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) module to compare NDVI levels throughout the years 2001 (the first complete year available), 2010, and 2020. As our study focuses on changes in recent greening, we then deploy open-source imagery from the Landsat 8 satellite to develop a measure of NDVI changes. We obtain imagery from each province across two periods: 2013-2016 and 2017-2020, and calculate corresponding NDVI values for each period. The NDVI provides a range from -1 to +1, corresponding to vegetation cover. The more positive the NDVI, the more extensive the vegetation cover: sparse vegetation is approximately 0.4-0.5, while dense forest approaches 1.0. We take the maximum NDVI values from each period and calculate the change between periods. We then identify areas in each province where NDVI changed significantly. A change of +0.3 in the NDVI represents significant greening, and across a short time horizon, likely requiring human intervention. If tree planting was successfully implemented, we would expect the growth of these newly planted trees to register as substantial changes in the NDVI. What We Found Inner Mongolia Inner Mongolia has gotten greener over time. Drawing on MODIS data (Figure 1), we clearly see that the region's average NDVI has improved from 2001 to 2020, especially during the summer peak and green season. However, the provincial story is less straightforward. Looking at our measure of NDVI changes across Inner Mongolia (Figure 2), we do see areas of NDVI improvement (green), but the region also contends with significant desertification and erosion (seen as negative changes in NDVI, in red), alongside other land development. Figure 2 Click to enlarge (6 MB).  Moreover, areas of significant change--where NDVI changed by more than 0.3 between periods--were limited. These areas are visualized in bright green in Figure 3, and represent a fraction of the total green area change seen above. Figure 3 Click to enlarge further with browser magnification (11 MB).  We drilled down on a few of these areas and obtained satellite imagery as available for each period. Two examples are pictured below (Figures 4 and 5). We aggregate this analysis in Figure 6, coding apparent changes in 9 sites as due to planting or natural forest growth (green, five of nine sites), agricultural activity (yellow, three of nine sites), or water effects our NDVI measures (blue, one of nine sites).1 The confounding role of agricultural activity on the NDVI suggests positive NDVI changes may not be due to tree planting. This includes what appears to be new irrigation systems, as seen in Figures 4 and 5. Figure 4: Inner Mongolia, Ordos The concentric circles are formed by central pivot irrigation systems.  Figure 6 Jiangxi Because of Jiangxi's southern climate, with more natural greenery and a less distinguished winter season, average NDVI across the province shows less seasonality and a less clear upward trend since 2001. Though average NDVI levels at the same time of year are generally higher than they were in 2001 and 2010, there is substantial variation by year. Comparing NDVI changes since 2017 (Figure 8), we see more areas of negative change in the NDVI in a specific band in the west of Jiangxi; this is likely due to specific image sampling issues during the 2017-2020 period. Excluding changes in this band, areas of major NDVI change (greater than +0.3 in the index, Figure 9) appear limited. Figure 8 Click to enlarge (16 MB).  Figure 9 Click to enlarge further with browser magnification (17 MB).  We examined 27 of these sites in Jiangxi (Figure 10). Like Inner Mongolia, the greening in these sites does not appear solely due to tree-planting or other development. Of the 27 sites, roughly half (13) appear to have greened due to agricultural activity, compared to 11 sites with greening that can be plausibly attributed to planting or other development. One such greening site is shown in Figure 11. The change in the remaining three sites can be attributed to water, where the NDVI is picking up water-adjacent greening and\/or reflection from the water's surface. Figure 11: Jiangxi, Ganzhou Explaining the Official Numbers and Future Prospects Our analysis of Inner Mongolia and Jiangxi shows each province experienced a marginal increase in NDVI from 2017-2020 compared to the period from 2013-2016, representing a small increase in plant and forest cover. However, major changes in NDVI were limited to only a few areas, representing a small fraction of each province's territory. Moreover, changes in forest cover appear less significant than would be expected based on official government tree-planting statistics. Even in the study sites where NDVI analysis found increases in vegetation, the changes do not appear caused by increasing tree cover. Instead, some of the changes were driven by other factors, including crop development, algae formation on lakes, and natural greening alongside rivers. One potential explanation for the relatively limited change in NDVI may be related to tree die-off. Planted trees may have not reached maturity and have low survival rates. This survival problem may be particularly acute in arid Inner Mongolia, where poplar trees were the planted tree of choice. Poplars grow quickly, making them well suited for local officials who want to demonstrate significant afforestation progress within tight timeframes. But poplars also require significant amounts of water, limiting their self-sustainability and making them particularly ill-suited for Inner Mongolia's arid climate. However, an alternate explanation is that government tree-planting statistics are inflated. External studies confirm that such inflation has happened before. Data from Global Forest Watch (GFW) found that previous efforts to increase forest cover in Inner Mongolia and Jiangxi were limited during the early 2000s: from the entire period between 2000 and 2012, GFW estimated forest cover in Inner Mongolia increased by around 54,700 hectares (around 4,560 hectares\/year), while Jiangxi cover increased by 137,000 hectares (around 11,400 hectares\/year). These estimates stand in stark contrast to provincial government statistics from the period. Officials reported that 718,562 hectares of trees were planted in Inner Mongolia and 267,032 hectares in Jiangxi in 2009 alone, a level of tree planting that is simply not supported by outside analysis. Recent province-level statistics make similar claims. For example, 2017 statistics report that Inner Mongolia and Jiangxi province manually planted 346,309 and 89,405 hectares of trees, respectively. This would represent a combined area larger than the state of Rhode Island (around 314,000 hectares). Although area calculations are outside the scope of our immediate analysis, the limited areas of major greening seen in our NDVI change index, as well as our spot analysis of several sites do cast some doubt that China's tree planting--at least in these provinces--has been fully carried out at levels suggested by government data. 1.

{"article":"North Koreas Tideland Reclamation Efforts.json","text":"North Korea's Economy  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors North Korea\u2019s Tideland Reclamation Efforts  In partnership with \n Stimson\/38 North \n and written by \n Peter Makowsky, \n Jenny Town, \n Michelle Kae, \n and Samantha Pitz  Latest ~200 square kilometers of land reclaimed since 2010 Impact efforts to create arable land for agriculture Published Dec 22 2021 1\u00a0year Go to map  Overview  Adequate domestic food production is a persistent challenge in North Korea, given its limited arable land. Long-term efforts to increase that capacity through tideland reclamation projects along the country\u2019s west coast began in the 1980s, although suffered serious setbacks in the first decade due to poor engineering and maintenance and natural disasters.  Learning from past mistakes, reclamation efforts under Kim Jong Un have been more successful, with nearly 200 square kilometers now in transition in the North Pyongan and South Hwanghae Provinces since 2010. However, the process of transforming coastal mudflats into fertile farmland is slow and thus, for the near term, has provided minimal relief to the country's persistent food shortages. Activity GEOINT shows an uptick in reclamation efforts along the west coast. Article  Timeline  Graphs  Background North Korea is located in a temperate climatic zone and experiences a combination of continental and oceanic weather. Much of the country is mountainous, with only about 19.5 percent arable land.1 The country's west coast waters are particularly shallow and are significantly impacted by daily tides. The swing between high and low tide oscillates between shallow but navigable waterways, which landlock fishing boats, and commercial shipping traffic for extended periods each day. The oceanic conditions, inhospitable to sea-going traffic, make an ideal environment for the creation of polders, low-lying tracts of land, enclosed and protected by dikes or levees. Polders are created to claim valuable farmlands from the sea. The process of reclaiming land from the sea is not a rapid one; it takes many years to naturally fill these areas with the rich soil \"runoff\" via the country's inland waterways. While time plays a key role in the creation of polders, the tracts undergo several phases. This creates fertile farmlands as the end game, but as it transforms from saltwater mudflats to arable farmland, the displacement of seawater with fresh water also provides an ideal habitat for fish farming and a prime location for building salterns. The introduction of polders in North Korea began under Kim Il Sung and continued in earnest under Kim Jong Il. There are approximately 12 major areas where tideland reclamation has been ongoing: the two largest areas are the Taegyedo and Honggondo projects, with the Taegyedo project reportedly reaching the goal of 8,800 hectares of reclaimed land in 2010.2 The others include: Tasado*, Kwaksan, Ansok*, Kumsong*, Unchon, Sohae-ri-Nunggum Island, Ryongmaedo*, Woldo*, Ssari-som, and Kangryong.3 While the extent of the area captured by these efforts is not known, since Kim Jong Il assumed power, a rough estimate gleaned from available commercial imagery, suggests that about 500 square kilometers of land has been reclaimed. A 2012 speech on land management by Kim Jong Un noted that the planned area of tidal reclamation totaled 3,000 square kilometers.4 In practice, however, the process of tideland reclamation has been long and fraught with risks. A prime example was in 1997 when a tsunami destroyed the dikes of Taegyedo after a decade and a half of reclamation work. This resulted in a major setback in the North's land reclamation efforts, as many of the dikes which formed the polders in this area were breached, resulting in the remixing of saltwater with the freshwater of the polders, rendering the land unusable for cultivation, at least temporarily. The government quickly began recovery efforts in Taegyedo and almost immediately claimed successes in rehabilitating its polders, although, much of what was regained can be credited to support given by international aid organizations such as Triangle.5 Despite these early actions, it was July 2007 before real progress was declared by the government on this project.6 Since the passing of Kim Jong Il, little has been captured in public statements regarding tideland reclamation. While reclamation efforts have been mentioned in state media and Kim Jong Un's speeches on occasion, they have not been central to economic plans or risen in prominence. This may be due, in part, to the fact that although dikes can be built rather quickly, filling these areas with soil from runoff cannot be rushed, making timelines for completion difficult to predict. The Building of Polders The creation of polders is not a quick process. Small, coastal polders can be more readily created, but as is frequently the case in North Korea, programs undertaken by the government tend to be conducted on a grander scale than what is often ideal. The process of creating polders begins with the building of dikes (also called breakers or levees) which can extend many kilometers offshore. In North Korea, dikes are of earth and rock construction. Power shovels extract those materials from nearby borrow pits or mountainsides located along the coast; in instances where dikes are extended out to offshore islands, the materials are often taken directly from those islands to reduce transport distances. Dump trucks are used in that transport, and finished dikes are topped with both paved and dirt roadways. As the dikes are extended into the sea, they, in essence, form causeways that ultimately join with other dikes to create an enclosed hydrologic area. These diked enclosures are fitted with spillways or sluices that allow water to flow out, while preventing seawater from coming in during high tide, although seawater is allowed to flow in for some of these newly formed reservoirs. Polders are often created at the mouth of a river, which carries mineral-rich, silty soil. The goal is to fill the large enclosures with the silt and soil carried by the rivers which feed into the polders, gradually displacing salt water with fresh water, and thus cleansing the salinity from the soil. Under normal circumstances, the rivers flow slowly, so when it reaches the newly created polder, the suspended soil separates and gradually fills in the polder, creating a new landmass ready for cultivation. Controlling the flow throughout this process is critical, so a series of canals and\/or channels are a common feature. North Korea generally follows these best practices when constructing its polders. It does appear, based on the quality and pace of polder development after the 1997 tsunami, that quite a bit was learned from the NGOs that provided disaster relief and development assistance. The capture of soil is accomplished in stages. It starts with the creation of the polder's outer boundary formed by large dikes, capable of holding back the sea during high tides and storms. Smaller dike enclosures are gradually added in a patchwork quilt-like pattern, normally beginning at the shoreline and eventually extending out to the distant, boundary dikes. As each fill with soil, additional enclosures are added. The entire process can take one to two decades to complete depending on the total area of the planned polder, although several hectares of arable land are created within a polder each year. During this process, a canal system is also constructed to support the polder grid, to ensure the land receives adequate irrigation during the dry seasons and excess water can be channeled away as weather conditions dictate. Several factors impact how long it takes to complete any one polder, size being foremost, but extreme weather during a particular year is another key variable. Moreover, the planned size for a polder can change over time. For example, the Taegyedo Tideland was declared \"completed\" in 2010, however, additional \"outer\" dikes are presently under construction, indicating that the term \"completed\" is relative. Bridging Activities During the Transition Period After the dikes are constructed and the tide waters are kept at bay, a new hydrological environment begins to emerge as the trapping of soil runoff begins. This new, albeit temporary environment, allows for other activities to occur, the two principal ones being aquaculture and the building of salterns. Aquaculture: Also known as aquafarming, it is the controlled cultivation of aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, algae, and other aquatic plants. Commercial satellite imagery provides insights on the flow of water into and around these diked areas; most of the plants and fish are from the sea, as opposed to freshwater, but reporting suggests there is a mix of fresh and saltwater reservoirs.7 Salterns: A saltern is an area or installation for making salt. This includes modern saltworks, as well as waters that usually contain high concentrations of halophilic microorganisms, including algae and bacteria. Salterns usually begin with seawater as the initial source of brine; water is then evaporated, usually over a series of ponds, to the point where sodium chloride and other salts precipitate out, allowing pure salts to be harvested. Both of these features are common during the long transition period it takes to convert the coastal mudflats into farmland. However, whereas the creation of salterns is likely temporary, an activity undertaken while salts are being removed from the soil, the North Koreans might try to maintain the aquaculture environments even after the transition is complete. This is especially true in the northern provinces, where a series of outer dikes provides a layer of protection to the canals and shoreline polders. Unlike the east coast, where offshore fish cage farms dot protected bays and coves, there are few if any protected water areas naturally suitable for aquaculture outside of the artificial breakers. Crops of the reclaimed land Once the reclaimed land is suitable for planting, which could take years to decades depending on the total area and composition of the polder area, rice and corn (maize) become the chief crops accounting for the bulk of harvest.8 Other plants from grains to soybeans can also be found growing in the rich soil of the polders. A Closer Inspection of Three Polders This report examines three of the more actively growing polders; two in North Pyongan province (Taegyedo and Honggondo) and one in South Hwanghae Province (Ryongmaedo). Within these areas, it is estimated that approximately 200 square kilometers have been enclosed by dikes since 2010, all of which will transition into arable land in the next decade or two.9 Taegyedo Tideland The farthest north of the three reclamation areas, Taegyedo Tideland is the oldest and most storied. Construction began in the early 1980s and while the project pressed forward with a degree of intensity under Kim Jong Il, the 1997 tsunami destroyed much of the breakers. This setback was instructive to the North Koreans. With the help of international assistance, they were able to salvage the project, however, work progressed in a more measured fashion and moderate pace afterward. The project was technically declared complete in June 2010.10 By then, rice was being planted in the newly created fields, and completed seawalls allowed for the creation of both saltwater and freshwater reservoirs, creating habitats for fish, shellfish, and lobster farming. Salterns also dotted the landscape. However, work continued on the project well past 2010, with approximately 45 square kilometers added by August 2012, and another 2 square kilometers by June 2013. Even after 2013, breakers were observed extending into the sea, indicating further additions were planned. Imagery indicates that by 2019, new extensions were evident, and by October 2020 an additional 20 square kilometers had been added. Despite few media mentions, work continues in this area, with nearly another 18 square kilometers added by November 2021. While these new areas are still in the transitional phase and will take still several years before turning into cultivatable land, the continued build out demonstrates the country's commitment to tideland reclamation. Honggondo Tideland Located east of the Sohae Satellite Launching Station, Honggondo has seen similar dramatic growth over the past decade. While imagery coverage for this area is sparse, making the development timeline difficult to assess, it appears that efforts on this project began in earnest around 2013. Breakwater construction began by May 2014, and by 2017, North Korea achieved reclaiming an initial approximate of 28 square kilometers. That continued to expand so that by 2018, another 12 square kilometers had been added, and by 2019, a total of approximately 76 square kilometers had been closed off from the tidal sea. Imagery of Honggondo shows fish and algae farms and the presence of salterns in this area, suggesting it was still in its transitional state and not yet ready to use as farmland. In May 2021, state media touted the second-phase completion of Honggondo Tideland, stating it was \"largest in its scale in history of tideland reclamation\" and that this phase was completed in half the anticipated time (four years instead of eight).11 The site was highlighted again in September for large-scale rice fields, but due to limited recent commercial satellite image coverage, the current status cannot be confirmed.12 Ryongmaedo Tideland Ryongmaedo Tideland, located in South Hwanghae Province is a much smaller project and has a very different structure than previously discussed tideland projects. In the northern areas, small islands dot the coastline, and breakers can be extended from island to island, giving them solid grounding. However, Ryongmaedo does not have this small island composition, and instead, breakers are extended open ended out into the sea (a much riskier venture) making the reclaimed area more fragile overall. In 2019, a Pyongyang Times article about the three reclamation projects reported that work in all three areas had been \"kicked into high gear,\" and highlighted the ideal conditions in the Haeju Bay.13 This project is still active, with an October 28, 2021 Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) report highlighting tens of newlyweds moved into new houses in this area, as they had volunteered to work at the Ryongmaedo tideland construction site, wanting to be a part of the \"struggle for enlarging the land of the country.\"14 Conclusion In the last decade, there has been an uptick in reclamation efforts along the west coast. In three of the key locations, Taegyedo, Honggondo, and Ryongmaedo, almost 200 square kilometers have been secured by dikes since 2010, approximately half of which were secured in the last three years. But the creation of polders and their transformation into arable farmland is a long-term process, spanning years to decades depending on the level of commitment, scale of the project area, and the ability to mitigate environmental challenges. Therefore, most of the aforementioned areas remain mud flats or enclosed reservoirs for now, offering little immediate relief to current food shortages. While these transitional areas can be used for aquaculture in the meantime, the scale of their operations is small and thus make only a limited contribution to the country's greater food needs.

{"article":"Exploring Chinas Footprint in the Andes Mountains_ Copper Mining in Peru.json","text":"China's Belt and Road Initiative  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Exploring China\u2019s Footprint in the Andes Mountains: Copper Mining in Peru  In partnership with \n College of William & Mary \n and written by \n Caroline Morin, \n Sophie Pittaluga, \n Charles Pritz, \n and Zak Zeledon  Latest poor environmental oversight of projects Impact socio-political tensions near mining sites Published Mar 11 2022 10\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  Expansion of copper mining is driving economic growth in Peru, which coincides with increased Chinese demand and investment in copper mining. Chinese involvement in Peru's mining sector varies by project and is often obfuscated through intermediary company involvement in mine acquisition or construction. China has five mining investments in Peruvian copper: three are operational and two are delayed from local community resistance. Construction and operations at several mines have led to environmental degradation and forced community relocation. Activity A unique GEOINT finding from this study shows that the Don Javier mine is operational when the Peruvian government labels it in the study phase.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  China strives to diversify its copper supply as domestic demand continues to increase. This desire, combined with the concentration of copper located in South America's Andes mountains, is driving increased Chinese investment in Peruvian and Ecuadorian copper mines. Copper is an important mineral used in electrical equipment, construction, and industrial machinery. Open pit mining is currently the most widely used technique, extracting copper ore near the Earth\u2019s surface rather than digging underground. However, open pit mining can have harmful environmental impacts. Tailings dams frequently accompany copper mining projects. They can store toxic waste extracts that seep into the bedrock or other bodies of water if not disposed of properly. Tailings dam impacts have also been reported to negatively impact local communities. Figure 1 - China's Copper Mines in Peru & Ecuador  Methodology This study utilized text-based data, commercial imagery, and land cover data to analyze all mines with publicly identified information regarding Chinese engagement. The land cover data is from the European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellite. Supplied with this study are downloadable spreadsheets that ark the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects as official, informal, or private Chinese money and ther structured observations.\u00a0 Locational files such as MZ and hapefiles are available for download that were mappable. Peru's relationship with China and its Copper Mining Industry Mining is a dominant sector in the Peruvian economy, representing 10% of Peru's gross domestic product (GDP), with copper-related activities representing 4% of Peru's total GDP. In 2017, over 60% of Peru's exports were minerals, copper being Peru's most important mineral export based on value. According to Peru's Ministry of Energy and Mines, the country is the second-largest producer of copper in the world. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased mining production, particularly of copper, was expected to be the primary driver of economic growth in the country. The liberalization of Peru's mining industry, beginning in the 1990s and fueled by foreign investments, increased production and capacity of mines. Ernst and Young found that mining investment in the country grew by 24.45% between 2018 and 2019, with China being a key player. The research provided in this study notes that Chinese-financed copper mining in Peru has come with a large environmental cost, despite Peru's environmental regulations and its 2018 creation of an environmental court that specializes in criminal and administrative environmental cases. In 2020, Di\u00e1logo Chino argues that legal agreements between Peru and China should include environmental measures to allow for further scrutiny of project impacts and potential sanction mechanisms when environmental safeguards are violated. Other locals, who participate in the \"No a la Mina\" activist group against mining, argue that the Peruvian government is choosing to ignore problems, including environmental and socioeconomic concerns, and is heavily incentivized by investors to allow the projects to proceed and grow.\u00a0 Operational Mines Toromocho Mine: China's Largest Overseas Copper Project The Toromocho mine in Peru is China's largest overseas copper project. The mine was acquired in 2007 by Aluminum Corp of China (Chinalco) The Peruvian government granted Chinalco a construction permit in July 2011 and work began soon after, pictured in Figure 2. The mine became fully operational in 2013 and commercial production began on June 17, 2015, as seen in Figure 2. Figure 2 - Initial signs of construction at Toromocho mine.  In the first year of production, Toromocho mine produced 182,288 tons of refined copper. Further, in 2018, there was an expansion of the mine with a projected 45% increase of copper output of 300,000 tons. See Figure 3 of expansion activity. Figure 3 - Extensive mining activity present at Toromocho  The infrastructure needed to produce copper at an industrial scale, in addition to the actual production and refining of copper, can lead to significant environmental damages. In villages nearby the Toromocho mine, communal water was contaminated by heavy metals, making it unsuitable for drinking according to a Stanford University study. This contamination is likely due to the large tailings dams\/ponds spilling into nearby water sources, pictured in Figure 4. In 2014, the Environmental Assessment and Control Agency (OEFA) cited Chinalco for water misuse, leading Toromocho mine to temporarily pause mining operations. In April 2019, the Ministry of Health diagnosed 27 children under the age of 12 years with lead poisoning, representing the far-reaching impacts of contamination from the Toromocho mine. Figure 4 - Construction and water impacts  Further, Toromocho mine negatively impacted local communities with plans in 2012 to resettle 5,000 locals to a newly constructed town 12 km away. The new town, aptly named New Morococha, and shown in Figure 5, was a $50 million dollar investment deal with Chinalco that projected to bring new economic opportunities and a higher quality of life. However, a 2011 Peruvian Ministry of Housing report found the new town to be prone to flooding, earthquakes, and soil subsidence. Of the 4,000 relocated people, only 75% settled permanently. From a 2018 study conducted by the Peruvian National University of the Centre (UNPC), 80.6% of the inhabitants of New Morococha think that their economic situation was better in the old town.\u00a0 Figure 5 - New Morococha  Despite environmental degradation and the impact on the local community, Toromocho mine continues to produce copper, and there are no current records of organized dissent against the mine. There are, however, noticeable differences in China's implementation of this mine compared to other mines in this study. For instance, Chinalco attempted to ensure resident livelihoods, yet failed in their execution, as evidenced by the prevalence of poor flood controls. The primary local job opportunities are jobs associated with the mine, which creates a dependence on Chinalco. This dependence has left many residents unemployed, as Morochocha resident Rolando Jer\u00f3nimo explains \"from the day Chinalco arrived, all work is subject to conditions. Once [the term of] your contract is complete, they no longer wish to renew it.\" Compared to other projects in this study, Chinalco is active on social media, but posts focus on the mine itself as opposed to investment in local communities. For instance, a February 2022 facebook post challenges viewers to guess the Chinalco's official colors. Another post from the same month shows two workers by the mine with the caption \"at Chinalco Peru we work as a team to achieve the best results\" (translated from Spanish). Figure 6 - Chinalco Peru Facebook post which says: Mark the correct option. What are the corporate colors of Minera Chinalco Peru? Blue, Yellow, Green, or Orange.  Las Bambas Mine: Failed Resistance to Halt Mine\u2019s Construction and Operation Las Bambas mine was acquired by a Chinese joint venture in 2014; China Minmetals Corporation is the majority stakeholder of MMG, the owner of the Las Bambas mine and the later discussed El Galeno mine. Commercial operations at Las Bambas mine began in 2016. MMG reported producing 311,020 tons of copper\u00a0in 2020. MMG plans to expand the mine with Chalcobama Phase I, which is scheduled to begin operations in 2022.\u00a0 Figure 7 - Layout of Las Bambas mine  MMG seeks to ensure direct benefits to communities around Las Bambas mine. According to MMG, the project is said to have generated 6,000 jobs, both directly and indirectly. The Facebook page for the mine touts MMG's educational and community health initiatives. Nonetheless, there has been recorded resistance from surrounding communities. MMG began the physical resettlement of the community of Fuerabamba in 2014, the year the Chinese joint venture acquired the mining site. The following year, 100 mine workers were detained for five hours by 400 community members, marking the beginning of years of conflict between community members and MMG. That same year, a provincial strike resulted in three deaths and 23 injuries of civilians and police officers involved in the hostilities and police response. Most recently, in October 2021, hundreds of residents of Cotabambas, located 34.52 km from the mine, blocked the road that allows copper transport from the mine to the Matarani port, located 330 km away. Since the mine became operational in 2016, Reuters estimates the mine has been closed for 427 days (as of February 2022). The mine has been documented by the Peruvian Society of Environmental Law to contribute to dust, sound pollution, vibrations. Moreover, the project has gained permits to water rights, further infuriating local indigenous communities that often do not have access to safe water.\u00a0 Figure 8 - Location of cities impacted by Las Bambas  Don Javier Mine: Conflicting Text Data Obscures Mine's Operation Don Javier mine is an open pit copper\/molybdenum\/lead\/zinc\/silver mine, owned and operated by Junefield Mineral Resources Holding Limited. We cannot determine from open company data or secondary reporting when Junefield Mineral Resources Holding Limited acquired the mine after the company\u2019s 2008 founding. However, as of March 2022, the mine is still reported by the Peruvian government to be in a pre-feasibility study stage, as shown in Figure 9. Commercial imagery, pictured in Figure 10, shows significant evidence of mineral extraction and human activity at the site beyond the study phase.\u00a0 Figure 9 - Peru's Ministry of Energy and Mines official dashboard for Don Javier, as of March 2022. The dashboard confirms that Junefield owns the mine and the mine's location. However, the dashboard notes that the mine is under construction (\"Estado Actual: Construccion\" in Spanish) and is specifically in the Pre-feasibility stage (\"Prefactibildad\" in Spanish). The claim by the Peruvian government does not match GEOINT findings.  Although Junefield Mineral Resources Holding Limited reports obtaining two million tons of copper ore from Don Javier mine to date, the Peruvian government still reports the mine to be in the pre-feasibility stage of development due to not having completed an initial Environmental Impact Assessment from 2019. This discrepancy could have been caused by China missing deadlines, the Peruvian government not inputting data or a combination of both. Ground truth cannot be determined based on available information. However, it is evident in commercial imagery (Figure 10) that operations are ongoing despite potential lagging or conflicting paperwork from the Peruvian government. The mine has two clear open pits with several benches (indicators of how far mining has progressed). The imagery further shows trucks traveling the roads around the mines; motor vehicle movement across snapshots of commercial images demonstrates activity in and around the mine. The growth of the tailings dam\/pond adjacent to the open pit mines shows long-term copper production. \u00a0 Figure 10 - Don Javier as an operational mine, 2021  Government documentation of environmental impacts related to the mine is also limited. There is a lack of media information on the community's response. Unlike other mining operations in this study, neither Junefield Mineral Resources Holding Limited nor Don Javier mine have an identifiable social media presence. The scarcity of text-based information further obscures China's role and impact. Delayed Mines El Galeno Mine: An Unknown Indefinite Delay El Galeno mine is an open pit copper\/silver\/gold\/molybdenum mine. Originally a Canadian-owned mine, the Chinese state-owned China Minmetals purchased the not-yet-constructed El Galeno mine on April 28, 2009. As seen in Figure 11, temporary structures, indicating an investigation of the site, became visible in the area within months after this purchase. From the Peruvian government's perspective, El Galeno mine represented a blossoming relationship with China, in which Peru intended to permit further Chinese ownership of more Peruvian copper mines. Figure 11 - Construction at El Galeno Mine, 2009 and 2021  Despite over 2.5 billion USD in global investment, in 2020 the Peruvian government reported the project had been in the pre-feasibility stage since 2007. Commercial imagery shows that the only visible change since 2009 is the transformation of the temporary structures to permanent buildings, as shown in Figure 11. There is little evidence (reporting or imagery) that mining activities have commenced. This analysis is further bolstered by the land cover data represented in Figure 12. The data shows that the buildings identified in Figure 11 were the only truly constructed area at the mining site as of 2020. The detection of scrub\/shrub, or overgrowth of small plants, as the primary feature at El Galeno further suggests that mining has not commenced. If mining had commenced, the land cover would primarily show bare ground, as the land must be devoid of all trees, grass, and shrubs to begin copper extraction. The land cover data does show four water features at the mining site, which are visible in Figure 11. These water features are not tailings ponds and are most likely natural, as they were visible in commercial imagery before relevant activities commenced in 2009. Figure 12 - Land Cover at El Galeno Mine, 2020  China Minmetals has not submitted the environmental impact studies necessary to begin establishing a mining timeline, meaning there is no expected start date for construction of the mine. A 2019 media source announced that the mine would begin operations in 2020; however, Peruvian government sources and commercial imagery both confirmed that the mine has still not been constructed. It is unclear why the Peruvian government acknowledges the lack of progress on El Galeno, while ignoring the current situation at Don Javier. Peruvian government publications interacting with the reality on the ground are vastly different between the two mines, despite reporting the same status, as shown in Figure 13.\u00a0 Figure 13 - Ernst & Young graphic created for the Peruvian government on the status of mine construction  It remains unclear why El Galeno mine has been indefinitely delayed. There are no reports of tensions between the mine and local communities. The Chinese stakeholders signed an accord in 2010 with the nearby community of La Enca\u00f1ada, Cajamarca agreeing to designate 90% of all non-skilled jobs to local residents. According to a Samuel Engineering 2007 pre-feasibility study completed for the Peruvian government, socio-economic baseline studies identified that the project would create jobs for the local communities, however, this has not come to fruition as the project is delayed.\u00a0 Figure 14 - La Encanada near El Galeno Mine  Rio Blanco Mine: Local Resistance Successfully Halted Mine Construction Located in the Piuria region of northern Peru, the Rio Blanco mine is a planned open-pit porphyry copper mine that lies on the northern end of the Peruvian copper-gold belt. In April 2007, the Chinese-owned Zijin Mining Group acquired the mine from the UK-based Monterrico Metals. According to a 2020 Peruvian government report, the Rio Blanco mine is currently in the feasibility stage, with no known planned date for construction and operation. If it were to be developed, the Rio Blanco mine would be among the 20 largest copper mines in the world. Commercial imagery confirms Peruvian government reports that no construction has occurred, as shown in Figure 15.\u00a0 Commercial imagery reveals a mountainous and remote area, confirming the lack of built structures for any purpose. The mine is not operational nor has construction even begun, but the mere planning of the mine has incited significant local resistance.\u00a0 Figure 15 - Land cover and commercial imagery at the Rio Blanco Mine, 2020 and 2022  The project has been delayed because of resistance from local communities regarding property rights and the environmental impact of the project. Communities demanded the protection of local water and voiced opposition to any and all mining activity in their localities. This opposition became formalized through consultations regarding the mine in 2002 and 2007, where 97 and 95 percent of the local population in the Ayabaca and Huancabamba provinces rejected the proposed mine, primarily on the grounds of the mine's negative impact on communities. However, a 2010 Peruvian government report found that no economic, educational, cultural, or other activities had taken place yet. Not all conflict surrounding the mine is peaceful; a 2005 investigation by the Peruvian government concluded that over 20 people were kidnapped and beaten after protesting against the project. These protests have continued over the past two decades; in April 2019 thousands of locals were still protesting the project. In terms of environmental impacts, a 2008 report by the Peruvian government found the project in violation of multiple environmental regulations relevant to mining operations, including inadequate environmental management and a lack of implementation of erosion control measures. The Peruvian government required Zijin Mining Group to deliver an acceptable rehabilitation plan for the mine in forty-five days, but it is unclear if this request was fulfilled by the Chinese company. It is also unclear how these environmental concerns compare to environmental concerns raised in relation to the other mines. At any rate, based on our analysis summarized in Figure 15, the area remains relatively undisturbed by humans. Unlike other Chinese-financed mines included in this study, the Rio Blanco mine proposal will include not only the copper mine itself, but also the construction of 25 km of new roads, the upgrade of 176 km of existing roads, 200 km of power lines, and the construction of storage and loading facilities at the port of Bayovar (located 800 km north of Lima). This additional infrastructure expansion is also not visible on imagery and delayed as well. Further, the mine is expected to produce 5,000 jobs during construction and 1,200 jobs during operation. As evidenced by the continued community protests, locals seem to place a low priority on these potential positive socio-economic benefits of the mine. This potential low prioritization of the socio-economic benefits leaves the question of whether other socio-economic initiatives at the other studied mines had a significant impact on the public\u2019s perceptions and interactions with the mine.

This discrepancy stands out in direct contrast to the up-to-date text-based information on the other four studied mines. China has been instrumental in developing Peru's mining industry and helping it be competitive on a global scale. While the Peruvian government supports Chinese mining, multiple mines have been severely impacted by local, grassroots resistance concentrated on environmental and socio-economic concerns. Organized resistance could delay or halt other Chinese mining projects not only in South America but other parts of the world.  Things To Watch Will China expand its presence by investing in more copper mines in the Andes? Will the proposed\/delayed mines become operational? Or, will local communities continue to effectively resist the mine construction?  How will China continue to fulfill its growing demand for foreign copper?

{"article":"Sustainability of Chinas Overseas Special Economic Zones_ Introduction.json","text":"Special Economic Zones  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Sustainability of China's Overseas Special Economic Zones: Introduction  In partnership with \n Columbia University \n and written by \n James McKinney, \n Jacqueline Davalos, \n Naoki Saito, \n Vishal Subramanian, \n and Igor Zavyalov  Latest Intro 10 overseas SEZs surveyed Impact Addressing sustainable development Published May 19 2020 2\u00a0years, 7\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  China\u2019s economic diplomacy has encouraged the use of special economic zones (SEZs) abroad. These areas of specialized regulation and incentives are aimed at attracting foreign investment. However, China\u2019s emphasis on SEZs to promote quick economic growth has raised questions about whether China is sacrificing sustainable development for speed. Sustainable development is the practice of providing for current demand without sacrificing the needs of future generations. In the past decade, China has proven that it has the capacity to deploy sustainable practices domestically. In this analysis, we provide a framework for assessing whether these best practices are successfully being exported to its overseas SEZ projects. Activity GEOINT can play a part in the analysis of multiple types of sustainable development. By utilizing physical infrastructure as a proxy, we can begin to assess how zones address problems with environmental degradation and worker relations. Article  Timeline  Graphs  Since the year 2000, China has increasingly sought to expand its influence abroad through ambitious infrastructure and investment programs like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). One integral component of China's BRI strategy is the establishment of overseas Special Economic Zones (SEZs), geographically distinct areas of special economic and legal incentives.1 Often, these take the form state-supported joint ventures between Chinese companies and a host local or national government. While these overseas SEZs are intended to provide both China and the host nation with a variety of economic benefits, studies suggest that China's overseas SEZ model has a mixed track record.2 Despite this, China has continued to promote overseas SEZs, and it is likely that the zone model will remain a core component of China's external economic engagement. Though the economic and political impacts of China's overseas SEZs have drawn much interest, other important impacts from zone development remain under-analyzed. Few studies have attempted to assess the sustainability practices of China's overseas SEZs, despite China's claims that the BRI emphasizes sustainability as a primary goal.3 As such, it is imperative to understand whether China's developments abroad align with its public rhetoric promoting social development and environmental protection, or whether China's overseas SEZs simply serve as an avenue for China to export environmentally harmful industry and social practices abroad. Why SEZs? Beginning in the 1980s, SEZs provided an important starting point for China's rapid domestic growth. These zones permitted radical experimentation with more efficient, market-oriented rules before a national commitment to economic reform was feasible. Designating specific zones allowed economic planners to concentrate capital and infrastructure in the hope of achieving new levels of economic efficiency. In the 2000s, including through the launch of the BRI in 2013, China sought to popularize its domestic SEZ development model and deploy it to other nations.4 However, a primary focus on growth in China's development model has also manifested social and environmental sustainability concerns. As China attempts to solve these domestic challenges, this begs the question: is China incorporating the lessons it has learned from building SEZs domestically as it replicates them in far-flung corners of the globe? Scoring and Metrics In this three-part series, we analyze the environmental, economic, and social sustainability features of China's overseas SEZs. We generate a series of preliminary indicators, that can be verified through open-source research and imagery analysis, to analyze the impact of 10 selected zones on local sustainability conditions. We focused on zones that receive the a \"state-level\" designation from China's Ministry of Commerce.5 If China's national government decides to highlight these zones, we expect a higher level of social and environmental accountability. Readers can download the coring and metrics data and view EZ facility annotations and satellite data. Environmental sustainability As hubs of economic activity, China's overseas SEZs have the potential to generate large impacts on the surrounding environment. How well these SEZs manage and mitigate these impacts present an opportunity for China to establish itself as a global environmental leader. Inspired by China's domestic standards for SEZs, we generated metrics for land use, water quality, air quality, and waste management.6 These metrics provide an initial means to evaluate whether China's overseas SEZs minimize environmental degradation and ensure the sustainable use of natural resources. Social sustainability Social sustainability is the ability to maintain a good standard of living within a community without having to lower that standard for future generations, and is an integral component of sustainable development.7 In assessing social sustainability, we analyze the following: health, education, quality of life, and labor relations. These indicators provide a good cross-section of development practices to evaluate whether China's overseas SEZs promote the well-being of the zones and surrounding communities, as well as the zone's capacity to support future generation's ability to maintain healthy and vibrant communities. Economic sustainability An SEZ's core purpose is to promote economic activity, trade, and development. Although host countries may seek to promote the growth of local industries, SEZs most often host foreign companies who manufacture and produce products for domestic consumption or export. Infrastructure to deliver inputs and distribute or export finished products is critical; without it, zones are likely to be unsuccessful. We thus evaluate the proximity and quality of roads, ports, airports, and rail links as a preliminary metric for an SEZ's long-term economic potential. How the Rubric is Applied: Pengsheng Industrial Park The Pengsheng Industrial Park is located near Syrdarya, Uzbekistan, and is one of China's attempts to foster goodwill and economic ties to Central Asia. Environmental sustainability We can observe that Pengsheng maintains and operates its own water treatment facility, identified often by the unique combination of round and rectangular water tanks in close proximity. This on-site treatment facility earns Pengsheng points in our scoring rubric for environmental sustainability. Water treatment plant at Pengsheng, Uzbekistan  Social sustainability Pengsheng also provides worker apartments next to greenspace used as a park. This worker housing is an important visual indicator for social sustainability, but must be balanced with research on both the quality of the housing, and whether the apartments are for local workers or simply imported Chinese employees. Worker housing at Pengsheng, Uzbekistan  Economic development and sustainability Pengsheng is located along a major highway that connects directly with Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent and its major international airport. Pengsheng is also near a capable rail yard that can also be used for distributing goods from the zone either directly to neighboring cities or to the international airport for export. Sardarya railyard, near Pengsheng, Uzbekistan  The rest of this series will explore Pengsheng and nine other Chinese overseas SEZs. Some Chinese-sponsored SEZs show much promise, while others appear to lag environmental and social best-practice. References 1.

We have argued for the value of including imagery in your analysis, especially in a world where open-source imagery is increasingly available. We expect to see more sustainability assessments include imagery as a way to verify claims towards progress made by both host nation governments and the operators of these zones. The information presented in this introduction and the articles to follow should arm you with tools to begin your own evaluations of the growing number of special economic zones around the world.  Things To Watch Are host nations and zone operators providing adequate information to justify their claims towards sustainable development? How can we supplement visible proxies with ever more complete contextual research? Will more attention on the subject of sustainability see more zones creating better infrastructure?

{"article":"Developments in North Koreas Sinuiju City under Kim Jong-un.json","text":"North Korea's Economy  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Developments in North Korea's Sinuiju City under Kim Jong-un  In partnership with \n North Korean Economy Watch \n and written by \n Curtis Melvin  Latest Provincial Capital Development Impact road\/rail underdeveloped for political projects  Published Apr 25 2018 4\u00a0years, 8\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  In order to help establish his long-term legitimacy as leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un has implemented numerous large-scale public works campaigns to raise living standards for targeted constituencies across the country.  In Sinuiju, it's unclear how successful these projects will be in promoting the Kim regime. Despite the city's unique role in DPRK-China trade, its transportation infrastructure remains neglected, and North Korea's new merchant class is assuming greater influence over the local economy. Activity Sinuiju City is the capital of North Phyongan Province. According to North Korea's 2008 census, its population was approximately 360,000, making it a mid-sized provincial-level city. Sinuiju rests at the end of the Yalu\/Amnok River across from the Chinese City of Dandong, and due to its geographic location, it is a vitally important link in trade between the two countries.\nIn the Text\/Timeline\/Graph features, we explore some of these economic and showcase political projects. Article  Timeline  Graphs  Sinuiju is the home of North Korea's most utilized road and railway trade arteries, yet the city's transportation infrastructure has not been a high priority for government investment. The road from Sinuiju to Anju (half the distance to Pyongyang) is still an unpaved dirt road. Additionally, the World War II-era China-DPRK Friendship Bridge used to facilitate trade with China, North Korea's largest trading partner, consists of just a single traffic lane and railway crossing and it is frequently closed for maintenance. National and local leaders have on multiple occasions sought foreign investment to improve infrastructure in Sinuiju through the establishment of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ). However, there has been little real progress. China built a new four-lane suspension bridge to Sinuiju at a cost of nearly $350 million to serve as an alternate transportation corridor, but North Korea has not allowed the new bridge to become operational since being largely completed in 2014. A Chinese company has also constructed a tourist resort on the Yalu\/Amnok river to serve Chinese tourists, however, its utilization appears to be far below capacity, and its impact on local infrastructure is negligible. (See exemplar image below). The Amnok River Tourist Area is the only noticeable economic project that has been completed in Sinuiju involving a foreign investor. Copyright 2018 DigitalGlobe.  Despite the economic benefit that could accrue to North Korea from improved transportation and trade infrastructure in Sinuiju, construction in the Kim Jong-un era has been largely mobilized to carry out economic and entertainment projects aimed at showing \"Kim Jong-un's love for the people\"--in other words defining and securing the leadership of Kim Jong-un. The kinds of projects being undertaken in Sinuiju, such as a new stadium, a new theater, school renovations, and new park construction are nearly identical to construction taking place in other provincial capitals, making it representative point of observation for signature projects of the Kim Jong-un era. However, it remains unclear just how popular and effective these centrally-driven projects are at meeting local demand for entertainment and generating political goodwill towards Pyongyang. (See exemplar image below). Bottom = skate park; right = 3D Rhythmic Cinema; top = traffic school. Copyright 2018 DigitalGlobe.  Sinuiju's legal and illegal (but tolerated) market economies, however, have seen significant growth in the Kim Jong-un era. Most of the large legal markets have been expanded or renovated, offering newer facilities and more stalls for vendors. This is a win-win for North Korean consumers as well as local tax authorities. Additionally, North Korea's burgeoning real estate market, which appears to remain technically illegal, has been growing to meet the demand for new and higher quality housing by North Korea's burgeoning capitalists. (See exemplar images below). New market construction giving more space to vendors and presumably generating more local tax revenue. Copyright 2018 DigitalGlobe.

In this regard, Sinuiju is perhaps the most important locality to keep tabs on owing to its importance in bilateral trade. \nFrom the standpoint of current policy, monitoring activity in Sinuiju is important from the prospective of enforcing US and UNSC sanctions. Areas of interest should include current and potential border crossing and shipping routes. Areas where North Korea has sought to attract foreign direct investment should also be monitored.  Things To Watch How busy are Sinuiju's ports and border crossings? Are improvements underway at factories associated with significant military production? Is progress being made on opening the new Yalu\/Amnok River Crossing? Is progress being made at any of the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) sites on the Yalu\/Amnok River?

Through imagery, we can identify subtle changes in the environment and apparent violations of sustainability principles in some Chinese SEZs, including dumping and landfills. GEOINT is also valuable for mapping local infrastructure around current or future zones to predict the environmental areas of greatest need. Activity Imagery will be used to both identify current problem areas in the environment, and to assess their severity in relation to the other zones surveyed. The focus is on locating the presence of facilities to offset these impacts as well as looking for evidence of current environmental degradation. Article  Timeline  Graphs  Evaluating Environmental Sustainability SEZs come in all shapes and sizes, often even spanning several industries within the same zone. This variation, and the differences in pollution standards, make direct comparisons challenging. So while using imagery to evaluate environmental sustainability requires visible SEZ features with likely environmental impact, such as steel mills, power plants, and oil refineries, we drew on a variety of sources to generate a more balanced assessment of environmental risk. Therefore, our analysis focuses on locating the presence of SEZ features that are associated with environmentally sustainable practices, and not solely on an SEZs carbon footprint. We selected indicators associated with land use, water treatment, air quality, and waste management. These indicators are built upon the larger body of sustainable development goals (SDGs) published and promoted by the United Nations. As an established, international framework of sustainable practices, the SDGs serve as a key repository of industry-accepted standards. China's public acknowledgment of SDGs, and their effect on overseas special economic zones, was outlined in a 2019 report conducted by the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. While this report is informative, and not legally binding, its publication by a government think tank to an international body shows that Chinese developers are well aware of what it takes to build and operate sustainable zones. Our research will show whether this knowledge is being passed along to the actual operators of Chinese overseas SEZs around the world. Next, we will explain how we operationalized these indicators. Indicators Land Use Framework Sustainable land use has two components. The first is the existence of a regulatory framework that governs land stewardship and environmental obligations. These frameworks are composed of both real estate laws that explain details of land ownership within the SEZ, and the environmental regulations of the host nation, as illustrated in Section B of this world investment report from 2019. Environmental law for SEZs can enumerate requirements for producing environmental impact studies, as well as ensuring that companies within SEZs remain under the jurisdiction of national environmental law. As an example, China's domestic low-carbon industrial park program, from 2013, began piloting mandatory preservation of green space within SEZs. The presence of programs like this gives us an opportunity to check if this leading environmental practice has made it to China's overseas projects. We will evaluate zones based on the presence on the existence and strictness of SEZ regulation, as well as using imagery to assess compliance by zone operators. Water Treatment Facilities We measure water quality in terms of identifiable water treatment facilities. These facilities are a key feature for achieving long-term sustainability, as seen in the framework on page 190, and applicable SEZ environmental laws can require them. Air pollution emissions We measure air quality in terms of the zone's source of energy production. All zones require electricity, guaranteeing it will be a shared feature, and since the zones we evaluated house vastly different industries, variation in the nominal amount of air pollution is expected. The indicator will assess whether the zone is reliant primarily on non-renewable energy sources or if it is blended with renewables. If available, we will also include information on whether emission capture technologies are present. Waste Disposal Facilities We measure a zone's waste disposal in terms of its facilities for disposing of solid waste. Waste disposal facilities are another required feature across SEZ regulation, such as seen in section 3.1 of Cambodia's SEZ law. We assess SEZs on a scale from simply dumping into the local environment to providing on-site, waste-to-energy facilities. Analysis Land Use Across zones, we found SEZs with strong regulatory and oversight frameworks provide general quality assurance for zones in a way no other indicator did. Of note was the Ethiopian Eastern Industrial Zone which showed strong performance across all our environmental indicators. Eastern Industry Zone, Dukem, Ethiopia  Eastern Industry Zone planning map, Ethiopia  The Eastern Industry Zone (EIZ) is governed by Ethiopian law from 2015 that sets national SEZ policy. It requires adherence to all Ethiopian environmental law as well as the establishment of the Ministry of Environment offices inside of each zone.1 This type of close government enforcement was not required during the EIZ's early stages, but its eventual enactment shows that Ethiopia is learning from experience and trying to improve its environmental enforcement despite initial problems and setbacks. As the image above illustrates, the Eastern Industry Zone has managed to adhere closely to its development plan - something that cannot be said for all our zones. Alternatively, the Zambia Chambishi Multi-Function Economic Zone (MFEZ) was the weakest performer in this category and displayed several features consistent with environmental degradation. Zambia's SEZ regulations only force its zones to provide an initial environmental impact assessment and to provide standard economic infrastructure. There is no explicit land-use framework governing zoning, and we observe minimal visible green space within the boundary of the zone. Furthermore, this lack of regulation and oversight has allowed zone operators to engage in acts of environmental damage including dumping mine waste into local rivers and pumping illegal quantities of pollutants into the air.2 Chambishi MFEZ and copper smelter, Zambia  Water Treatment Water treatment was one of the most reliable indicators we used, providing a unique visual signature that we could identify in most zones. Kawasan Industri Terpadu Indonesia China (KITIC) and Khorgos Eastern Gates SEZ were the highest performers in terms of water treatment. Both appear to have developed multiple on-site treatment facilities. Khorgos has developed water treatment facilities capable of treating 3,000 m3\/ day, as well as a drinkable water supply system and a sewage pipeline and collections system. Water treatment facility, KITIC SEZ, Indonesia  Other zones have had decidedly mixed results. Zones operating in countries with poorly enforced regulatory frameworks can be legally committed to building on-site water treatment facilities but may not have constructed them even as industrial operations in the zone begin. Laos, a country with a history of poor enforcement, allowed Saysettha Development Zone, near Laos's capital of Vientiane, to offload all its water treatment burden onto already taxed municipal facilities. Despite Laotian law requiring SEZs to provide wastewater treatment facilities, 10 years after its creation, Saysettha still divides its water treatment burden across four municipal facilities: Chinaimo, Kaoleio, Dongmakkhay and Dongban. As of 2014, these facilities were unable to meet their existing municipal treatment responsibilities and only through the rapid expansion of existing facilities is supply able to even catch up to growing demand. Map of Vientianne, Laos, regional water treatment facilities from 2015 water supply report  While our analysis emphasized indicators that are commonly found within all our zones, there are also additional sources of water contamination, related to SEZ operations, but located outside of our zones. A particularly noticeable example of this is the TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone in Egypt. The TEDA zone has an on-site treatment station; however, its off-site natural gas power plant appears to directly dump water used for cooling the plant back into the Red Sea. Although this type of thermal effluent is potentially a source of undesirable effects on local marine ecosystems, we do not consider it in our scoring because the plant is not a direct part of the SEZ. While a zone operator may not be responsible for the operation of a separate power plant, this demonstrates that environmental effects from an SEZ may escape its physical boundaries and produce regional effects. Water treatment facility, TEDA Suez SEZ, Egypt  Discharge of thermal effluent from natural gas power plant, near TEDA Suez SEZ, Egypt  Air Pollution The difference between most zones turned out to be the level of energy diversification: whether plants exclusively used fossil fuels (coal or natural gas) generation plants or integrated renewable energy sources. In several zones, including Saysettha, we identified renewable hydroelectric energy sources in addition to traditional coal or LNG facilities. Zones with diverse energy sources earn a higher score than those that solely use fossil fuels. But the expense of integrating renewable sources, in comparison to the cheaper alternative of coal, may create strong economic pressures against selecting the more sustainable alternative. Mekong hydropower dam near Saysettha Development Zone, Laos  In the case of Saysettha there was a readily available renewable energy source in the Mekong river that was cost-competitive with coal-fired thermal plants. This investment in the Mekong hydropower dam system now powers 53% of the country, including the zone. Alternatively, the worst performers were entirely reliant on coal-fired thermal plants with no additional emissions control features. Sihanoukville in Cambodia, for example, is entirely reliant on lignite-fired coal power plants. The current energy supply is provided by two different plants, provided by Cambodia Energy Limited (CEL) and the Cambodia International Investment Development Group (CIIDG). Both plants are undergoing expansions, with CIIDG building a dedicated transmission line to the SEZ to ensure consistent supply. Despite this rapid growth in power in the last 10 years, the Sihanoukville SEZ is also moving forward with building a 5 boiler, 100 MW coal plant inside the zone itself. Regional energy supply is also soon to be supplemented with another imported Chinese coal plant whose SOX, NOX, VOC and CO2 profile has been deemed too dangerous and polluting for China.3 Sihanoukville coal power plants, Cambodia  Although we do not score zones based on their industrial activities, the imagery suggests these can be a significant additional source of pollution. For example, the Chambishi zone features several copper smelting furnaces, which emit potentially harmful gases out of large attached chimneys. Beginning operation in 2008, a 2014 investigation by the Zambian Environmental Management Agency saw that from 2009-2011, Chambishi either did not report, or exceeded the statutory limit, on sulfur dioxide emissions for every month on record. A newly constructed facility, for the first three years of operation, demonstrably violated Zambian environmental law. This case shows the need for both strict regulatory enforcement, as well as not relying on any assumptions that newer facilities will necessarily prove to be more sustainable. Chambishi copper smelter, Zambia  Once again, it is worth mentioning that there are multiple sources of air pollution that were not directly incorporated into our scoring. These limitations are observable in the TEDA Suez SEZ, which houses the Jushi fiberglass factory, a product whose production can emit unhealthy air emissions. Jushi fiberglass plant, TEDA SEZ, Egypt  Our selected indicator does not account for the emissions produced by the industrial output of these type of factories, for example, the fiberglass plant, since they do not qualify as primary energy-producing facilities. Waste Management We lacked sufficient imagery to evaluate several zones for waste management, but those zones for which we could identify features scored poorly. The most common form of waste management across our zones appears to be landfilling or dumping. This is unsurprising as many SEZ laws require waste management procedures but do not specify or require sustainable recycling or waste to energy practices. Saysettha, for example, contracted out its solid waste management which has resulted in all its waste being dumped in one of Laos largest landfill sites K.M.32.4 Kilometer 32 landfill near Saysettha SEZ, Laos  KITIC in Indonesia has fulfilled its minimum waste disposal requirement by utilizing the Bekasi Controlled Landfill Disposal Facility located in the suburbs of Jakarta, and already receives 6,000 tons\/day of waste.5 It is likely that the SEZ is adding a significant waste burden to an already heavily utilized landfill. Based on existing imagery and information, we were unable to evaluate waste treatment capacity at several zones, including TEDA, Khorgos and Pengsheng. Conclusion Development of SEZs increase the risk of negative economic impacts and sustainability practices should be a major concern. Our assessment of Chinese overseas SEZs has demonstrated that while China has publicly declared its commitment to reducing the environmental impact of SEZ development, its track record in establishing environmentally sustainable SEZs abroad has been mixed. Of ten zones evaluated, several showed good performance with respect to land use, air protection, water treatment, and waste management. However, other zones, such as Chambshi and Ogun-Guangdong, fared very poorly, suggesting sustainability principles are inconsistently applied in China's SEZs. Time and resource limitations limited the number of indicators we used as well as our ability to evaluate zone types. Further analysis evaluating zones by key industries such as mining or manufacturing could provide more granular interpretations. In the next part of this series, we evaluate China's overseas SEZs impact on workers and local residents. References 1.

{"article":"Chinas BRI in Latin America_ Case Study - Hydropower in Bolivia.json","text":"China's Belt and Road Initiative  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors China's BRI in Latin America: Case Study - Hydropower in Bolivia  In partnership with \n College of William & Mary \n and written by \n Matthew Crittenden, \n Caroline Morin, \n Remington Fritz, \n Emily Maison, \n William Weston, \n Kaitlyn Wilson, \n Sophie Pittaluga, \n and Asha Silva  Latest mobilized opposition has delayed construction Impact negative impact on the environment  Published Jun 1 2021 1\u00a0year, 7\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  In line with the push for environmentally friendly Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure projects and Bolivia's former President Evo Morales' \"2025 Patriotic Agenda\" to transform Bolivia into a regional energy hub, China has supported six hydropower energy projects in the country. The success of these projects vary, and are more dependent on domestic factors in Bolivia than the actions of China. The Bolivian government has exercised minimal influence on the implementation of the six hydroelectric projects due to domestic political turmoil and an overarching agreement requesting China's investment in energy projects. Instead, opposition and discussions regarding the dams have manifested at the local level. There are mobilized grassroots opposition movements reported at four of the hydroelectric projects in reaction to the negative impact on indigenous communities and the environment. Activity This article examines evidence of six BRI hydroelectric power projects in Bolivia. Satellite imagery shows that two hydroelectric power plants (HPP), San Jose I and II, have been completed. However, for the other four hydroelectric power projects, construction has not or has barely begun. Our analysis indicates these indefinite delays are partially due to local movements protesting the negative impact of the projects on the environment and indigenous communities, as well as the larger context of political turmoil in Bolivia and COVID-19. Article  Timeline  Graphs  In 2013, the Chinese Government under the leadership of President Xi Jinping launched a series of infrastructure investments and diplomatic endeavors known as China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). With over 3,485 projects across 138 countries and over 273.6 billion USD in official Chinese financing, the size of the BRI is unprecedented. The BRI seeks to stimulate economic growth through connective infrastructure built by China, with the support of the recipient country. It assumes that these projects will have positive spillover effects for nearby sectors while attracting more investment. The BRI is heavily concentrated in the Afro-Eurasia geographic regions and has, in recent years, expanded to Latin America and the Caribbean. As of 2020, nineteen countries in Latin America & the Caribbean have signed BRI agreements. Many critics have questioned the relative success of BRI projects, focusing on unintended consequences, such as the impact on the environment and indigenous populations, and the quality of implementation. Original work, geoLab  Chinese investment in renewable energy through the BRI could help to improve energy security and transform energy sectors to favor low-carbon emitting sources in recipient countries. However, a significant portion of BRI energy projects is fossil-fuel-based. And of the non-fossil fuel energy projects China is financing in South America, many are hydroelectric power projects, which carry their own environmental consequences. In June 2018, the Chinese and Bolivian governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) stating that Bolivia would join the BRI. In the years leading up to and subsequent to the establishment of the MoU, China's investments in Bolivia have continued to grow. These investments have largely been concentrated in the hydropower sector. Former President Evo Morales believed that the exportation of surplus energy from HPPs would provide a stable solution to Bolivia's energy and economic issues and, as a result, concentrated Chinese investment in the hydropower sector. Bolivia's geography of both the Andes Mountains and Amazon Rainforest lends itself well to the construction of hydroelectric power projects. By partnering with the Chinese, Morales put these HPPs at the center of Bolivia's national development strategy. This could not have been accomplished without Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) providing financing and technical knowledge on hydropower development. In 2011, the installed capacity connected to Bolivia's National Grid System (SIN) was 1.31 gigawatts (GW). While electricity generation has increased since then, it remains largely dependent on natural gas, rather than renewable sources. Over the past decade, the demand for electricity in Bolivia has skyrocketed and has led to a series of outages and unsatisfied demands. Original chart work, geoLab with sourcing from U.S. Energy Information Administration.  There are currently six proposed hydroelectric power projects (HPP) in Bolivia. Of the six, only two have been completed--the San Jose I HPP in 2018 and the San Jose II in June 2019--and are both now producing energy to the national grid. Larger projects, such as the Ivirizu and the Rositas HPPs, are still under construction due to delays caused in part by mobilized opposition against the projects, as detailed in the report and in the corecard. The Chepete-El Bala Dam and HPP Complex were supposed to start construction in 2019, along with 13 other infrastructure projects which were all announced in 2015. Satellite imagery shows that construction of the HPP has yet to start as of January 2021. Original work, geoLab  Lessons to take away from project outcomes: The hydropower industry continues to face an interconnected web of challenges and opportunities that are continually evolving. Hydroelectric power projects have the potential to revitalize local communities by providing jobs and stimulating economic activity. Many hydroelectric power projects contracted by China's SOEs have ignored environmental impact assessments. These projects have negative impacts on the surrounding environment, including deforestation and loss of biodiversity. Consultations of proposed infrastructure projects with local peoples are required under international and Bolivian law. However, a number of proposed hydroelectric power projects have not been approved or even shown to local populations. Without proper consultation, thousands of Bolivians will be displaced and their lands could be inundated. This has caused numerous indigenous-led protests against the construction of these projects. Methodology In this article, and the case study on hydropower in Ecuador which will be released in the near future, each BRI project was analyzed in the context of the environment, community impact, and legal indicators. These three indicators were then broken down into relevant success factors. For each success factor, each project was ranked as unsuccessful (0), neutral (1), or successful (2). To rate the overall impact of the dams, the scores for each dam were averaged out, creating a scaled ranking of unsuccessful (0 - 0.68), neutral (0.69 - 1.34), and successful (1.35 - 2). For more information on the specific rankings for each project and success factors, see the corecard of hydro project factors. Also, download our RI threshold matrix to see what factors we used to classify projects as BRI or not.\u00a0 The Bolivian Context Former Bolivian President Evo Morales entered office in 2006 as Bolivia's first indigenous president, a group that makes up 41% of the nation's population over the age of 15, according to the 2012 census. Morales' platform, while primarily focused on indigenous rights, included the 2025 Patriotic Agenda, which outlined, among other objectives, Bolivia's transformation into a regional energy hub through the generation of 3,000 megawatts (MW) of hydroelectric energy for domestic use and exportation. To accomplish this ambitious goal, Morales commissioned a series of hydroelectric power projects, many of which were to be built or funded through China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). While two of the six BRI-associated projects have been completed, most are at a standstill, falling short of public declarations. Morales envisioned Bolivia becoming the \"energy heart of Latin America,\" and saw hydroelectric power as the means by which to achieve this. This is in part due to the country's geography, home to the elevated Andean mountains and the Amazon rainforest, a landscape that contains a large potential for hydropower production. In order to achieve this, Bolivia needed financial backing, which would come from Chinese BRI investments. While the hydroelectric power projects are meant to expand Bolivia's clean energy supply, the projects have had damaging consequences, including the displacement of indigenous peoples and destruction of the wildlife and biodiversity, countering Morales' platform championing indigenous rights. In 2019, Evo Morales ran for and won an unprecedented fourth term. Unlike Morales' previous re-elections (that were still beyond the two-term limit previously enshrined in the constitution), his run in 2019 was marked by a low degree of support by Bolivian citizens leading up to the vote. Instead, his refusal to accept term limits backed by a majority of Bolivians strengthened opposition and led to a series of protests against his candidacy. The Bolivian public's ability to quickly organize a mass mobilization became apparent in the series of protests, in which at least 36 people died and many more were injured, that occurred following Morales' victory claim. The protests successfully forced Morales to resign as multiple foreign entities, including the Organization of American States (OAS), published claims of electoral fraud. In October 2020, Luis Arce was elected with a landslide majority of votes in a closely monitored presidential election. 1 Luis Arce has made it clear that his government will work closely with Xi Jinping's government to cultivate the relationship between Bolivia and China, claiming that the nations' friendship is \"unbreakable.\" Prior to becoming Bolivia's President, Arce promoted economic development through foreign investment, mostly from China, as the Minister of the Economy and Finance under Morales. However, this came at the expense of Indigenous Peoples' rights and preservation of ecosystems and biodiversity, as several planned hydroelectric power projects and dams were visualized to be constructed in protected areas and the Amazon. Despite these negative factors, the political relationship between Bolivia and China remains strong. Since Arce assumed office, China has supported Bolivia in more humanitarian ways by aiding in COVID-19 vaccination distributions, suggesting that the relationship between the two nations goes beyond the BRI investments in renewable energy infrastructure. Completed Hydroelectric Power Projects: San Jose I & II Hydroelectric Power Plants (HPPs) Located on the eastern slopes of Bolivia's Andes Mountains in the Cochabamba Department, outside Carrasco National Park, the San Jose I and II HPPs provide energy to Bolivia and beyond. The San Jose I and II HPPs aim to meet the nation's growing energy demand and increase reliability and security of future power supply. This joint project was constructed by the Chinese state-owned Sinohydro Corporation and the Bolivian state-owned Empresa Nacional de Electricidad [National Electric Company, (ENDE)]. The Morales administration worked closely and relied heavily on BRI financed infrastructure projects, such as the San Jose I and II HPPs, to complete Bolivia's 2025 Patriotic Agenda, which included achieving energy independence and becoming an energy exporter to Bolivia's neighbors--Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru--through the National Interconnected System (SIN). The SIN connects major urban areas in seven of Bolivia's nine departments, the equivalent of states in the US, accounting for 84% of the national demand for electricity. The Morales Administration strived for the rational and efficient use of natural resources to expand and improve their national energy matrix. The San Jose I and II HPPs were connected to Bolivia's national grid system in January 2018 and June 2019, respectively, which is verified by the below August 2018 and August 2019 imagery. However, it is unclear how much of the energy produced at the San Jose I and II HPPs will be exported. Many Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) struggle to meet the standards and safeguards their host country requires for projects, such as HPPs. In many cases, these companies fail to provide an accurate environmental impact study, or none at all. For instance, in Ecuador, Sinohydro never completed a geological examination for the infamous Coca Codo Sinclair Dam and HPP complex, leading to the dam being constructed on a fault line. The lack of due diligence is concerning for other governments and businesses who have contracted Sinohydro. For San Jose I and II HPPs, the environmental and community development failings, as reflected in our indicators, demonstrate Sinohydro's relative ignorance of the local context and needs. The San Jose I and II HPPs have both positive and negative impacts in the field of community development, with an verall neutral rating. Regarding positive impacts, the projects combined provide 124 MW of electricity, which has improved the quality of life for over 700,000 Bolivians in the Cochabamba Department through the introduction of reliable electricity. Additionally, Sinohydro relied on local labor to construct the two HPPs, providing over 1,000 new construction jobs for local and indigenous communities. These new jobs have provided much needed economic wealth for workers and for the local Bolivian economy. Regarding negative impacts, there is no record of other economic or social development benefits to the local communities. Further, construction was stopped at both HPPs in January 2016 by a worker's strike at the construction site. Approximately half of the Bolivian laborers, around 500 people, were demanding the compliance of Bolivian and international labor laws, and the end of discrimination towards the Bolivian laborers by the Chinese laborers. Anonymous testimonies discussed the lack of industrial safety, workers' dormitories that were falling apart, lack of food, and abuse of employment contracts. Many signs at one of the protests read, \"Basta de discrimacion, esto es Bolivia no China\" [Enough discrimination, this is Bolivia not China], referring to how Bolivian workers must be treated with respect and Bolivian labor laws must be followed. The strike lasted less than a week and was resolved by Sinohydro signing 14 agreements to improve conditions. Due to a lack of data, it is unclear whether Sinohydro followed through on these agreements. It is important to note that Sinohydro's mistreatment of workers and poor safety conditions has occurred at construction projects across the world, including at Ecuador's Coca Codo Sinclair Dam and HPP complex. The events at San Jose I and II are not abnormalities. According to the Development Bank of Latin America, the San Jose HPPs saved 7.81 billion cubic feet of gas, exponentially reducing CO2 emissions in the surrounding region. However, the environmental impact of the San Jose HPPs extends beyond simply reducing CO2 emissions. Per our corecard, despite the large reduction of CO2 emissions, the projects are unsuccessful in the land and biodiversity environment indicators. Both San Jose I and II HPPs are located close to Carrasco National Park, one of Bolivia's most biologically diverse parks. Both facilities saw large amounts of deforestation near valuable water sources, which has the potential to destroy ecosystems. As visible in the comparison of the 2013 satellite imagery to later images of both HPPs, visible deforestation exists even beyond the areas where the main facilities are located. The environmental impacts of large infrastructure projects, including deforestation, will be exacerbated by the additional infrastructure that is needed to support these facilities and connect them to the national grid. For the San Jose I HPP, not only was land cleared for the powerhouse, reservoir, and access roads, but additional land was cleared for storage facilities to house materials during construction (August 2018 image) and the SIN's transformer and transmission lines (August 2019 image). San Jose I imagery San Jose II imagery Construction Delayed: Rositas Hydroelectric Power Plant (HPP) Located in the Santa Cruz Department of Bolivia, the Rositas Hydroelectric Project Complex is expected to generate between 500 and 600 MW of energy once completed. Funded by the Export-Import Bank of China, the dam is projected to cost between $1 to 1.5 billion USD. The Rositas HPP has a long history. The project was originally proposed in 1987 and has been reconsidered multiple times. The project was expected to begin energy generation in 2024; however, this goal is presently unrealistic given the current state of the HPP shown by satellite imagery as well as the backlash it has provoked. In terms of the construction timeline and all of our indicators, the Rositas HPP project is decidedly unsuccessful. In 2016, the Bolivian government awarded the construction contract for Rositas project to the Accidental Rositas Consortium Association [Asociacion Accidental Rositas Consortium, (AARC)], which is composed of the Chinese SOE China Three Gorges Corporation, its subsidiary China International Water and Electric Corporation, and the Bolivian construction company, Reedco SRL. The Bolivian national power company, ENDE, will oversee AARC's construction of the Rositas HPP. It is unclear when construction will resume due to the mobilization of indigenous and human rights groups against the dam, and former President Evo Morales briefly suspending the project. Per our ommunity development indicators, the Rositas project will have a resounding negative impact on local communities and their livelihoods. The Rositas project will span 452 km2 traversing five municipalities. Within this impacted area, large flooding areas will displace twelve different indigenous communities, one of which is visible in December 2019 imagery, encompassing thousands of people. This flooding area will eradicate much of the communities' critical infrastructure, including schools, roads, power lines, and a crucial bridge over the local Rio Grande. However, the HPP would irrigate 164,000 hectares of agricultural land, supply drinking water to Santa Cruz, and reduce the risk of flooding downstream. Yet, it is unclear if any of these benefits will be visible and accessible to the directly impacted indigenous communities. Impacted indigenous communities claim that there have been no informed consultations regarding the project by the Bolivian government or the AARC. The right to informed consultations and the voicing of consent prior to the installation of impactful infrastructure projects is required by the International Labour Organization's Convention 169 on Indigenous Peoples and the 2009 Bolivian Constitution. Since the 1970s, indigenous resistance has been one of the primary reasons for the lack of construction progress at Rositas project. Grassroots mobilized resistance has only grown and become more formalized since then. In 2018, the Guarani communities of Tatarenda Nuevo and Yumao sued ENDE for violating their rights. The case was controversial, and included human rights defender Nelson La Madrid receiving threatening messages and attempted police detainment. After taking their case through three separate courts, the communities' petition was ruled as inadmissible.2 Protests by indigenous communities have been compounded by backlash regarding the environmental impacts of the Rositas project. The project is located in three protected areas: the National Park and Integrated Management Area Serrania del Inao [Parque Nacional y Area de Manejo Integrado Serrania del Inao], the Integrated Management Area Rio Grande-Valles Crucenos [Area de Manejo Integrado Rio Grande-Valles Crucenos], and the Parabano Municipal Protected Area [Area Protegida Municipal Parabano], which together house nearly 2,500 species of plants and 570 species of animals. The deforestation caused by the project--the potential of which is visible in the 2019 imagery--removes part of the carbon sink, and consequently, increases CO2 emissions by approximately 70 million tons (due to the lack of trees absorbing CO2). The flooding discussed in the previous paragraph, which displaces twelve indigenous communities, will also impact the habitats of thousands of species, some of which are endangered. The changed river flow could impact the quantity of water and sediment load transported downstream, both of which impact those communities that rely on the water for sustenance and agriculture. Some environmental opposition groups to the dam cite Bolivian Law 2727, which protects the Serrania del Inao region. Others claim that the river's high sediment loads would fill the reservoir with dirt within 30 years, a commentary on the long-term functionality of the dam. Indigenous women in the community of Yumao have organized yearly demonstrations against the construction of the Rositas dam, bringing awareness to the detrimental impacts of the hydroelectric project on biodiversity and indigenous rights. As of December 2019, the construction of the Rositas complex was being \"reconsidered\" by former interim-President Jeanine Anez. It is unclear what the final consideration verdict was, largely due to continued political turmoil and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the months following the December 2019 announcement. But if groups, like the Yumao women, continue to protest, what activists call the \"dam of death\" may never resume construction. Construction Delayed: Ivirizu Dam and HPP Complex In 2017, Sinohydro, a Chinese state-owned hydropower engineering and construction company, was awarded the opportunity to lead the construction of the Ivirizu hydroelectric power complex in the Pocona municipality on the Ivirizu River, in the Bolivian Carrasco National Park. Sinohydro committed to investing $550 million USD over four years for the construction of the dam. The Bolivian hydropower company, ENDE Valle Hermoso, would assist Sinohydro with the construction, while the Central Bolivian Bank would finance the project. The Ivirizu hydroelectric power project was a part of Evo Morales' 2016-2020 National Economic and Social Development Plan and is estimated to be completed in 2021. The dam and the HPP complex will consist of two power plants--Sehuencas and Juntas--which will jointly provide 280MW of energy to the national grid, helping Bolivia achieve its long-term goal of increasing the domestic supply of hydropower while bolstering Bolivia's status as an energy exporter. In October 2020, construction of the diversion channel at the project was completed. As of March 2021, construction is still ongoing for the rest of the project. Since September 2019, there have been active signs of construction as identified via satellite imagery. Additionally, recently, Indar, a Spanish construction company, has been contracted to provide generators for the two HPPs. Sinohydro hopes to widen and develop roads that will lead directly to the Ivirizu dam and HPP Complex. Based on the imagery and on-the-ground sources, evidence of preliminary construction and movement of materials is visible, suggesting that Sinohydro's project is moving forward. The June 2019 satellite image below depicts several signs of construction, including: a bridge for transporting materials, supporting infrastructure to house materials, land clearing for the main water reservoir, and road construction. Beyond the slow pace of construction, Ivirizu is expected to have a elatively negative impact on the environment, which has been largely ignored by the Bolivian government. The impact of construction is evident in the deforestation and rerouting of the Ivirizu river, as visible in the annotated satellite imagery shown below. Approximately 1,235 acres of land would have to be cleared within the protected forest area for the construction of the project, taking a tremendous toll on the park's rich biodiversity. However, the mayor of Pocona, Juan Carlos Rodriguez, has assured the media that the hundreds of different species of flora and fauna would not be greatly affected by the construction of the dam due to regulations put in place. ENDE Valle Hermoso has also made efforts to rescue, preserve, and return species to the park. ENDE ambitiously stated that for every hectare of land that is deforested, they will plant double the amount of trees. While ENDE Valle Hermoso and Mayor Rodriguez have stated that the Ivirizu dam will not have significant environmental impacts, its construction in the untouched Carrasco National Park still suggests otherwise. Regarding community development success factors, there are notable positives including the improvement and development of roads and the generation of employment opportunities for 3,000 people, 80% of whom are Bolivian--not Chinese--laborers. The majority of the analyzed sources were published between 2017 and 2019, suggesting that there is limited data and information about the Ivirizu project's progress. The lack of reporting on construction updates could be, in part, due to the turbulent presidential transition from Evo Morales to Luis Arce and the COVID-19 pandemic, both of which could have put the Ivirizu project on pause since late 2019. Another potential barrier could be the lack of accessible indigenous sources, due to the remoteness of the impacted communities. Construction Postponed: Chepete-El Bala Dam and HPP Complex The Chepete-El Bala Dam and HPP Complex is being constructed on the Beni River in the Amazon region of Bolivia. The project is proposed to be completed over the next 10-15 years with a combined energy generation capacity of 3700MW. However the construction, which was supposed to begin in 2019, has been indefinitely postponed due to major backlash over the project's negative impact on the local communities and environment. In 2015, China and Bolivia signed an official agreement for China to construct 13 infrastructure projects, including the Chepete-El Bala Complex. While specifics for who is funding and implementing this project, including the specific companies involved, has yet to be announced, the project is clearly part of the official 2015 agreement between the Chinese and Bolivian governments. According to an article from the World Politics Review, Bolivia inherited the debt and assumed the risk for most Chinese-financed infrastructure projects. A majority of these projects are contracted out to Chinese companies through turnkey contracts, which \"place [China] in charge of both design and construction, bringing their own materials, equipment, technology, and often their own labor.\" With turnkey contracts, Bolivian government oversight and involvement with the project shrinks dramatically. While the type of contract for the Chepete-El Bala Complex is unknown, the lack of transparency and government oversight has caused outrage among environmentalists and local communities. In our indicators, Chepete-El Bala Complex scored low in the legal indicators because of this contract and protests against the project. The low legal indicators for the project are complemented by an even lower nvironmental rating. The Chepete-El Bala Complex intersects with the Madidi National Park [Parque Nacional Madidi] and Pilon Lajas Biosphere Reserve and Communal Lands [Reserva de la Biosfera y Tierra Comunitaria de Origen Pilon Lajas], which together are one of the most biologically diverse and well-preserved areas of the Amazon rainforest. There is risk of soil degradation, disappearance of river-side beaches, and changes in fish migration and reproduction. Between 200-600+ species live in the park and their habitats would be altered by the potential floodplain, as outlined in the December 2020 imagery. This floodplain could hold water in a space covering almost 680 square kilometers and up to 200 meters deep, this potential reservoir is visible in the below imagery. This de-facto swamp would emit large amounts of greenhouse gases and toxic methane gas. There is an expectation of large levels of deforestation from road construction, transmission lines, and water reservoirs. Finally, the complex is located in a geologically unstable area that is prone to intense rainfalls and landslides, all of which could cause the dam to fail. For the people who call this area home, this is not just an environmental issue. The local interdependence with the natural environment reveals the socio-economic impacts on local communities. As previously discussed, Bolivian law, along with International law, guarantees indigenous groups an open consultation when an infrastructure project is proposed in their area. If constructed, the inundations would displace 4,000 local inhabitants, including those citizens of the communities Rurrenabaque and San Buenaventura, and other communities visible in the June 2018 image. Neither the Bolivian Government nor Chinese contractors have offered a clear plan for resettlement or any sort of compensation for these lost lands. In response to the potential construction, the advocacy group the Coordinator for the Defense of the Amazon [La Coordinadora para la Defensa de la Amazonia] was founded to represent those indigenous peoples most affected by the construction of the Chepete-El Bala Complex. Due to the organizing efforts of this group, a number of protests against the construction have occurred, including one in November 2016 that blocked GeoData, an Italian firm working with the Bolivian government to study the viability of the dams, access to the construction site. The protest was ultimately successful as GeoData withdrew their engineers and equipment, citing a lack of community consensus for the dam as their reasoning. Conclusion Our analysis shows that the implementation and relative success of the BRI in Bolivia is dependent on SOEs mitigating local community concerns and tempering rushed political declarations with measured action. Each of these six projects scored poorly on environmental indicators, demonstrating the SOEs' haste to construct the projects and disregard of the potential environmental impacts. This could have been amplified by the domestic political situation in Bolivia. While in office, Morales was struggling to meet his widely publicized overarching goals on energy. The public pressure for the success of the 2025 Patriotic Agenda incentivized the Morales administration to quickly enter into infrastructure development contracts, even if those contracts disadvantaged the role of Bolivian stakeholders, as turnkey contracts have the possibility of doing. However, the majority of interactions with BRI actors occurred at the local level, not between government actors. This is potentially due to the national-level political turmoil in Bolivia. Resistance was led by local communities and activists on the grounds of negative impacts on local indigenous communities and the environment. Grassroots mobilization delayed four out of the six projects. It is unclear whether these projects will resume construction or when construction will be completed. Notes 1. Hours after polls closed in Bolivia's controversial October 2019 election, Morales claimed outright victory, without the official posting of results. After 24 hours of no results, Morales was officially announced winner with 47.08% of votes just above the 10% requirement as his closest opponent won only 36.51% of votes. The mass protests and lack of transparency around the electoral process caused the Organization of American States (OAS) to investigate. OAS's preliminary report questioned the reliability of the results and recommended another electoral process to be held in order to guarantee the electoral integrity of the results. Originally, Morales claimed the government would hold another full election to certify the results; however, he and his VP Garcia Linera resigned after the request of multiple influential bodies. Following their official resignations, 2nd Vice President of the Senate Jeanine Anez was appointed as interim president. Anez was originally to serve as interim president only until an election was held within 90 days. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the election had to be postponed multiple times and Anez was in power for almost a year until October 2020. Her presidency was marked by claims of corruption and mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic that left Bolivia with one of the world's worst per-capita death rates from the virus. After almost a full year of uncertainty, in October 2020, a monitored presidential election was held. Luis Arce, a member of Morales' Movement Toward Socialism Party and the controversial former president's Economy and Finance minister for almost 12 years, was elected with a landslide majority of votes. Arce's close ties to the former leader sparked suspicions among Morales' opponents, but Arce claims that there will be no role for Morales in this administration. 1 The judge ruling over their case claimed: \"the plaintiffs cannot be considered affected when there are no regulations, or an active project, nor can they claim to be affected until studies are concluded that must be carried out by ENDE prior to the consultation.\" The communities responded that the courts did not consider documents demonstrating how they would be impacted by the flooding and displacement.

{"article":"Impacts to Cultural Heritage in Ukraine.json","text":"Ukraine  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Impacts to Cultural Heritage in Ukraine, 1 July through 31 August 2022  In partnership with \n Cultural Heritage Monitoring Lab (CHML) \n and written by \n Damian Koropeckyj, \n Kate Harrell, \n Kaitlyn Fitzgerald, \n Abigail Maher, \n Hayden Bassett, \n Madeleine Gunter-Bassett, \n and William Welsh  Latest 207 Confirmed Heritage Site Impacts Impact Damage to Ukrainian Heritage Infrastructure Published Sep 15 2022 3\u00a0months, 3\u00a0weeks Image Credit  Go to map  Overview  This report summarizes confirmed impacts to cultural heritage sites due to the conflict in Ukraine between July and August 2022 by the Cultural Heritage Monitoring Lab (CHML). The methodology for the confirmation process relies on analysis of high-resolution commercial satellite imagery which has been supplied by CHML's partnership with NGA. In total, CHML analysts confirmed conflict-related impacts to 99 cultural sites between 1 July 2022 and 31 August 2022, totaling 207 since 24 February 2022. The Cultural Heritage Monitoring Lab, a partnership between the Virginia Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative, has monitored and recorded impacts to cultural property across Ukraine throughout the ongoing conflict. CHML has utilized the best available technology, practices, and expertise to create a comprehensive cultural database of Ukraine including a vast array of structures, monuments, landscapes, and places of cultural importance. Activity When Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, CHML was poised to begin real-time or near real-time monitoring. CHML has adopted two categories, leads and potential impacts, for geolocating open source leads and the exploitation of remote sensing data for identifying potential impacts on heritage sites. Reporting on the potential impact levels can be conducted solely through the use of publicly accessible data, allowing for rapid dissemination of potential impacts to CHML's stakeholders and the wider public. With commercial satellite imagery, potential impacts are then reviewed to determine if they can be confirmed. There is a time lag inherent in the confirmation process due to satellite periodicity, but this lag is a matter of hours or a few days, meaning CHML can typically report confirmed impacts within 72 hours of a kinetic event. Article  Timeline  Graphs  Definitions Lead: A lead designates an unconfirmed, open source report that a heritage site has been damaged, and is therefore utilized as a starting place rather than as a confirmation. Common leads include social media posts, single-source interviews, and unconfirmed news reports. Potential Impact: A potential impact is a classification used to designate cultural heritage with possible damage. Sites are classified as \u201cpotential impacts\u201d when they are determined to have a moderate-to-high probability of having sustained damage due to direct overlap with, or proximity to, remotely-sensed kinetic activity. Both leads and potential impacts are used as tips for queuing further investigation via satellite imagery (i.e., \u201ctip and queue\u201d). Confirmed Impact: Leads and potential impacts are re-classified as confirmed impacts when additional, independent lines of intelligence confirm that a site has indeed been impacted. Most impacts are confirmed through the identification of damage in satellite imagery. Other confirmations come from multi-sourced news, social media, or Russian news reports, such as reporting on Russia's seizure of artifacts in the Melitopol Museum. Methodology This report is the second in a series of confirmed impact analyses. The data presented here represents analytical confirmations between 1 July and 31 August 2022, and not necessarily the dates of impact. To be clear, the July-August window does not imply that the impacts occurred between these dates, merely that CHML analysts confirmed an impact to a site during this time. All impacts occurred from 24 February 2022 onwards. The figure of 207 confirmed impacts adds the more recent 99 confirmed impacts to the last report's 108 confirmed impacts. The basis of this research is a 28,000-site GIS database maintained at CHML. CHML is housed at the Virginia Museum of Natural History and monitors cultural heritage destruction around the world in partnership with the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative. The development of the Ukrainian dataset was initiated in April 2021 in order to identify cultural heritage destruction in eastern Ukraine and Crimea after the Russian annexation of the peninsula in 2014. Initially, the inventory consisted of 26,000 sites, but additional data scrapes and contributions by researchers in the field have contributed to a current inventory of over 28,000 sites. CHML\u2019s geographical dataset recognizes Ukraine\u2019s pre-2014 borders, and thus includes heritage sites in eastern Ukraine and Crimea. The research methodology did not include an analysis of damage attribution, and thus the results may include damage caused by either Russian or Ukrainian Armed Forces. This data does not include monuments that were removed by the Ukrainian government, for example, portions of the Arch of Freedom of the Ukrainian People, which were dismantled on 26 April 2022. CHML's cultural heritage inventory was developed in collaboration with the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative. The categories of historical and cultural spaces that qualify as cultural heritage sites were taken from the Cultural Heritage Site List (CHSL) data standards, developed by the Penn Cultural Heritage Center (PennCHC) at the University of Pennsylvania Museum (National Science Foundation Grant #1439549). The geographic dataset was derived from open sources, academic publications, gray literature, and the contributions of professional colleagues. New sites are regularly added to the dataset. Nevertheless, there are some notable omissions. CHML's inventory of 28,000 sites does not fully account for all of the cultural heritage sites in Ukraine\u2014in particular, the great number of governmental and educational buildings that are also historic structures. There are also hundreds (if not thousands) of new burial and mass burial sites (from 24 February 2022 onwards) in Ukraine and these have not been added to the inventory. From February to August 2022, CHML analysts monitored over 28,000 cultural heritage sites in Ukraine using open source research, remote sensing, and high-resolution commercial satellite imagery. The inventory is maintained and visualized in the GIS, with monitoring activities providing inputs to a \u201csite status\u201d field. Monitoring occurred every 48 hours, with the status for each cultural site remaining or shifting between \u201cno impact detected,\u201d \u201cpotential impact,\u201d or \u201cconfirmed impact.\u201d Remote fires sensing data released by NASA FIRMS is pulled and overlaid on the cultural inventory GIS layer. Sites in the geographic areas overlapping FIRMS locations are marked as potential impacts. From there, CHML analysts review each potential impact with commercial satellite imagery to identify whether there was any visible damage to the site. Simultaneous research on the open source provides additional reporting of potential impacts via social media and news media. These leads are geolocated so that they can also be queued for confirmation via commercial satellite imagery. Open source leads in particular may document damage to a site that is not visible in commercial satellite imagery, so many of these impacts remain unconfirmed. The conservative nature of CHML\u2019s approach means that confirmations should be taken as a minimum number of actual impacts. Operational Security Note Highly detailed and precisely geolocated heritage site data is not included in this study for operational security purposes. However, abstracted and aggregated analyses have value to show broad trends and categories. New and Updated Total Findings with Charts and Heat Map Visualization Table 3: Last (older) report as reference: Confirmed Impacts to Cultural Heritage Sites in Ukraine up to 30 June.  Trends This new tranche of confirmations generally follows the same patterns observed in the first report of confirmed impacts, with the notable addition of impacts to the Conservatory\/Concert Hall category. Thanks to open source reporting concerning impacts to these sites, it was recognized that musical venues were not in CHML\u2019s inventory of heritage sites. Like the conclusion made in CHML\u2019s first report, analysis of Table 1 suggests that there are inherent resolution problems in the satellite imagery confirmation process. The impacts likely overrepresent larger sites and structures and underrepresent smaller sites, such as memorials and monuments. Damage to sites with a smaller or less visible footprint is less likely to be recognized as such in satellite imagery. The sites will require the use of additional confirmation methods to determine if damage has occurred.

Gemstones have long been a source of wealth for both miners and for those who control the supply. Geospatial analysis of gemstone mining sites in Afghanistan answers critical intelligence questions related to these sites. Activity Afghanistan has long been a source of gemological wealth, with Lapis Lazuli being mined and exported for several millennia. In recent times, other gemological minerals such as emeralds and tourmalines have been mined and sold on the global market to jewelers and collectors. With the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, the current mining situation has not been broadly covered in open reporting. Gemstone deposits may be a lucrative source of income for the new Afghan government. This project, through geospatial analysis, assesses baseline and historical changes to major gemstone mining sites to find out if mining has increased, decreased, or stayed the same and establishes a monitoring protocol for future research. Article  Graphs  Location of the Mines Figure 1: Overview of selected mining sites in Afghanistan - ESRI ArcGIS Pro  Critical Intelligence Questions What is the current status of activity in mining areas?\nHas mining activity increased, decreased, or stayed the same?\nWhat changes in local infrastructure can be observed?\nWhat changes in the population of local villages can be observed?\nWhat evidence of increased military activity can be detected near the sites?\nWhat indications of recently mined material making its way to global markets can be detected through social media, open reporting, or other sources? Executive Summary What is the current status of activity in mining areas? Four of five mining areas observed with recent imagery show active mining or newly constructed mining infrastructure. Has mining activity increased, decreased, or stayed the same? In four of five mining areas, mining activity has increased. At Sar-e-Sang at least one new mine portal has been opened. At Panjshir there are extensive new spoil piles and diggings. At Mawi there are new tailings. At Dara-e-Pech there are several growing spoil piles. What changes in local infrastructure can be observed? Mining infrastructure has visibility increased at four of five recently observed sites. At Sar-e-Sang there are several new mining buildings near mine portals. At Panjshir there are dozens of new mine buildings and a fenced-in structure near the village that may be mining related. At Mawi there are over a dozen new mine buildings and several restored buildings. At Dara-e-Pech there are foundations for new buildings. What changes in the population of local villages can be observed? There are local villages near four of the five recently observed sites, and three of those four villages show new additions and buildings, suggesting an increase in population. Moreover, this growth signals increased local wealth from mining. At Sar-e-Sang there are several buildings with new roofs, one completely new building, and one large building was razed. The changes suggest that people are planning to move into the village for year-round residency. There are also more vehicles in the town, suggesting increased population and wealth. At Panjshir there are additions to several buildings, a new mosque, approximately double the number of new cars, and construction equipment. This suggests both an increase in population and an increase in local wealth. What evidence of increased military activity can be detected near the sites? There are no GEOINT signs of increased military activity. Gandhara, an Afghanistan-focused news site associated with Radio Free Europe reported in February 2022 that Taliban fighters were visiting emerald mines to see if new miners might be former police and military.1 However, this was not observed on available imagery, nor are there obvious roadblocks or tolls present. What indications of recently mined material making its way to global markets can be detected through social media, open reporting, or other sources? Note the province in Afghanistan listed, Pajnsher.  Background Afghanistan has been a source of gemstones for thousands of years. Through all the conflicts and changes in the past several decades, gemological minerals continue to be mined at many sites, often with proceeds going to various militant groups ranging from the Mujahideen, to local warlords, and the Taliban.2, 3 With the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in the summer of 2021, the country is once again in a state of change and its economy has been negatively impacted. The United States froze billions of dollars of Afghan government funds, which reduced the new Taliban government's ability to operate.4 Additionally, the Taliban have frozen all foreign currency exchange for Afghan citizens. This decision will increase commodity sales for income and taxation. The majority of foreign aid and World Bank-funded projects have ceased.5 With increasing poverty and a shortage in funds, it is likely that both the Taliban and citizens will look to lucrative gemstone mining (which could provide hundreds of millions of dollars a year) as a source of income. Baseline and analysis of the sites Sare-e Sang Figure 1.0: Overview of Sar-e Sang - Copyright Maxar - 2022-04-15  Historical background Sar-e Sang is the world's main mining site for the famed blue stone Lapis Lazuli and is likely the longest continuously mined site in the world, mined for over 9000 years. In recent times, the mines were controlled by whoever controlled the region. During the Soviet invasion from 1979 to 1989, the site was controlled by the Mujahideen where Lapis was taken by mule to Pakistan to be sold to raise money for weapons.6 When the Taliban took over the country in 1989, the site was controlled by anti-Taliban groups who continued selling Lapis Lazuli via Pakistan to raise funds.6 During the US war in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021, control of the mines was mostly under regional warlords, although there were efforts made to create a more legitimate domestic market.6 In 2013, the Lajwardeen Mining Company won a contract to mine the site but was expelled by local militia in 21 days.7 The production was estimated to be worth $125 million a year in 2014 and local militias were making up to $18 million a year from leases and tolls, and splitting the proceeds with the Taliban.8 Mining information Lapis Lazuli occurs as blocks in marble layers that run for several kilometers north-south to the east of the Kokcha River. Most of the mining occurs near the settlement of Sar-e Sang. The mining occurs as small 2-3-meter-wide adits dug into cliff faces. These lead no more than a hundred meters into the mountains due to a lack of ventilation. Dynamite is the preferred method of excavation when available. Sometimes generators are used to power drills. Miners carry freshly dug Lapis Lazuli on their backs down to the village, which is later transported by mules or vehicles.9 Material excavated from tunnels is tossed out of the portals, forming light-colored \u201ctailings\u201d which are visible in imagery (See Figure 2.1). Fresh tailings can be used as a way to monitor new mine activity. Mining portals are difficult to observe unless imaged at the right time and angle. Figure 2.1: Example of mine tailings coming out of mine portals in the cliffs from 2020-07-30 (36.21113, 70.80256) Copyright Maxar  Mining baseline It is difficult to establish a baseline regarding the number of active mines because both active and abandoned mining portals are scattered throughout the mountain. In 2013, it was reported that there were 23 active mines in the area.10 From imagery prior to 2021, new tailings and mine portals were observed. Between 2017 and 2021, one new tailings pile and two areas of active mining were observed (See Figure 2.2). There is little visible mining infrastructure in the imagery although at one mining site to the south of the village there appear to be rudimentary stone structures (See Figure 2.3). Figure 2.3: Example of mining-related buildings at the south mine area (36.20307, 70.802) Copyright Maxar 2022-04-15  Village baseline It is unknown if Sar-e Sang has a permanent population. There are hundreds of small buildings in the village but the majority are in disrepair. Roof collapses are common and often not repaired (see Figure 2.4). Imagery analysis up to 2021 showed one to four vehicles present in the village (see Figure 2.5). Figure 2.5: Example of a vehicle, likely a car, on 2020-05-19 (36.20827, 70.79107) Copyright Maxar  Mining changes Figure 2.7: New mine building measuring 3 x 4 meters observed in imagery from 2022-04-15 (36.211, 70.801) Copyright Maxar  Town changes The number of vehicles observed in town increased significantly in 2021\/2022, ranging from five to thirteen vehicles of varied types and sizes (see Figure 2.8). Between 2021-12-10 and 2021-04-15, new roofs were erected on several older buildings and a 13-meter building was constructed on the north side of the village (see Figure 2.9). On the south side of the village, a 20 x 20 meter building (36.208, 70.791) was torn down sometime between 2020-07-30 and 2021-10-28 (see Figure 2.10). This building was one of the larger ones in town and had stood for more than five years. It was also the largest metal-roofed building in town. The restoration of roofs and construction of new buildings during the winter season suggests that people are considering Sar-e Sang for year-round residency rather than just the mining season. It is not known what the large metal-roofed building was used for or why it was torn down, but four large trucks were parked where the building stood on 2021-10-28 and may have been used to haul off materials. Figure 2.10: Large metal roofed building removed between 2020-07-30 and 2021-10-28. Several large trucks are parked at the site on 2021-10-28 (36.208, 70.791) Copyright Maxar  Panjshir Figure 3.0: part of the Panjshir valley mining area on 2019-07-20 (35.4241, 69.77735) Copyright Maxar  Historical background The emerald deposits of Panjshir were discovered in the 1970s in the mountains east of the Panjshir river valley. Much of the mine ownership has revolved around tribal and family lines.11 The villages of Khenj and Mikeni were \"boomtowns\" that supplied the labor for mining in the nearby mountains.12 In 2016, CNN reported that Afghanistan sold about $50 million in emeralds.13 In 2018, the gemstone industry estimated over $100 million in emeralds was exported from the country.14 The valley itself was a stronghold for resistance fighters and withstood the Soviet invasion of the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s. With the US withdrawal in the summer of 2021, the Taliban seized Kabul, and resistance fighters gathered in the Panjshir valley as a holdout location. This was the last province to fall to the Taliban in September of 2021.15 Emerald mining continued after the resistance ended and many former combatants and policemen became miners in the area.16 Mining background The emerald deposit covers an area of approximately 150 square kilometers, running northeast and southwest on the east side of the Panjshir River. In earlier decades, mining was accomplished with hand tools, dynamite, and hand-powered drills. This created narrow horizontal adits up to 50 meters into the mountain.17 In more recent decades, the mining techniques have modernized slightly with the use of excavators to create trenches and small open-pit mines. As of 2014, the Afghan government claimed all ownership of mining land and production rights but did not establish regulatory frameworks.18 When snow closes the digs at the higher elevations, miners work at lower elevations or sift through previously excavated rock for overlooked specimens.19 With the new Taliban rule as of fall 2021, dynamite for mining was no longer legal for purchase which makes mining more difficult.20 Mining baseline There are numerous mines and small-scale diggings throughout the mountain ranges. Mining portals are difficult to see on imagery, but the resulting tailings and spoil piles are easily recognizable on imagery. Likewise, trails going up to mining sites are also visible on imagery. One of the more notable aspects of Panjshir mining is the buildings constructed near the mine portals; these several-meters long rectangular buildings are built from rocks removed from the mines. (see Figure 3.2) These buildings are used for shelter and are usually close to mine portals. An examination of one area of mining (35.424, 69.787 - dubbed Site A) of approximately 0.125 square kilometers shows approximately six buildings built between 2017-08-02 and 2019-07-20 (see Figure 3.3). Figure 3.3: Site A changes over time. Top image from 2017-08-02 shows tailing piles and road. Middle image from 2018-09-08 shows new mining buildings. Lower image from 2019-07-20 shows new buildings and excavations (35.424, 69.787) Copyright Maxar  Village baseline Change in the larger towns of the Panjshir valley is constant. Therefore, it is more difficult to establish baselines. For example, the nearby Khenj district has a population of approximately 110,000 people.21 It was more manageable for this project to establish baselines for villages in small valleys closer to mining areas, for example, in the village of Deh Mikeni (35.42786, 69.80563). From 2017-2019 there were approximately 18 building complexes in the village, with only one new building constructed during that timeframe. The number of vehicles in the village ranged from three to six. There were also five to six half-sized containers in the village, which may have been used for storage or as small shops for mining supplies (see Figure 3.4). Figure 3.4: Part of the village of Deh Mikeni from 2019-07-20 (35.42803, 69.80554) Copyright Maxar  Mining changes Figure 3.5: A dramatic increase in mining buildings and spoil piles at Site A from 2019-07-20 to 2021-10-31 (35.424, 69.787) Copyright Maxar  Village changes The village of Deh Mikeni experienced construction expansion from the period 2019-07-20 to 2021-10-31. The total number of buildings remained the same but many of the building complexes gained new additions and one small house was removed. A new mosque was constructed in the village during this time. On the northeast side of the village, there is an unusual excavation where part of the hillside was excavated then the material was hauled to a newly constructed walled-in area. Another new excavation is present on the southeast side of the village. The number of half-sized shipping containers in the village has increased (Figure 3.6). Thirteen cars were present in the village, more than double than previously observed. All vehicles were parked in a large parking area near the mosque (2021-10-31 was a Sunday, most mosque attendance is on Fridays). Figure 3.6: Changes in Deh Mikeni between 2019-07-20 to 2021-10-31 (35.42786, 69.80563) Copyright Maxar  Additional notes Fifteen kilometers to the southwest of the main emerald mining locations, some unusual excavations (35.35677, 69.61188) were observed in 2021. For example, a graded road threaded its way through four large excavations. Each excavation has four square pits set into a larger square footprint (see Figures 3.7 and 3.8). These may not be related to mining but they are significantly large for the area and in the same mountain range as the emerald mines. Figure 3.9: Unusual road construction and digging activity on 2021-10-07, 2021-10-19, and 2021-10-31 (35.36949, 69.6513) Copyright Maxar  Dara-e-Pech Figure 4: Overview of the Dara-e Pech mining area on 2022-04-15 (34.952, 70.818) Copyright Maxar  Historical Background Tourmaline and kunzite were first found in the hills of the Pech Valley in 1959 and soon locals were collecting the crystals and selling them in street markets in Kabul. In the mid-1980s, specimens from the area started showing up in European and American mineral shows and began entering collections.22 Some of the finer specimens from the site sell in the four-to-five-figure range to collectors with one of the finer specimens valued at $250,000.22 In 2013, political instability slowed mining down in the area. However, in 2015, the government claimed all mining rights.22 Mining background There are multiple mines in the Pech valley with the majority located at lower altitudes near villages and the remainder located higher on ridge lines. Several of the mining areas have 20 or more tunnels that can span over 300 meters. Open reporting suggests that the mine lacks proper equipment and safety precautions.23 Imagery shows tailings, spoil piles, and buildings near the mines. Mining baseline overview Mining activity is concentrated in the north mine area (34.953, 70.81973) and the south mine area (34.95166, 70.81869). Between 2017-08-24 and 2020-10-24 at the north mine, one new building complex was constructed and several additions were added to existing buildings. Two spoil piles grew larger during this time (see Figure 4.1). Moreover, five new buildings were built at the south mine and two new spoil piles formed (suggesting new mine portals), while two existing piles grew by up to five meters (see Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: Many new buildings, new spoil piles, and growing spoil piles at the South Mine between 2017-08-24 and 2020-10-24 (34.95166, 70.81869) Copyright Maxar  Village baseline Figure 4.31: Example of a vehicle in the village on 2017-08-24 (34.95434, 70.81441) Copyright Maxar  Mining changes and analysis It was noted in the baseline that from 2017 to 2020 there was continuous mining activity at the north mine area. However, between 2020-10-24 and 2021-09-12 there was limited change to the north mine area. The spoil piles at the north mine do not appear to have increased in size, indicating little or no new mining. The only new infrastructure is a newly constructed fenced-in area that may be used for securing materials. A small pit was excavated on the east side of the north mine and could be a test pit for future mining (see Figure 4.4). Figure 4.4: A new pit and a new fenced in area built at the North mine between 2020-10-24 and 2021-09-12 (34.953, 70.81973) Copyright Maxar In contrast to the north mine, mining activity at the south mine continued from 2020 to 2021 as indicated by the growth of multiple spoil piles, including one that increased by five meters in length. Furthermore, between 2021 and 2022, spoil piles continued to increase in size, indicating continued mining activity (see Figure 4.5). At least one new building is under construction near these mines by early 2022. Additionally, a gridded structure was built on top of one of the largest spoil piles which could be solar panels (see Figure 4.6). Figure 4.6: Growing spoil piles and new structures that may be solar panels at an area of the South mine from 2021-09-12 to 2022-04-15 (34.95174, 70.81861) Copyright Maxar  Village changes Between 2020-10-24 and 2021-09-12, no new buildings were constructed. However, three buildings were expanded. The number of vehicles observed during the timeframe remained the same, three. From 2021-09-12 to 2022-04-15, new construction included three new roofs and the foundation for two additions (see Figure 4.7). GEOINT suggests the town is continuously expanding its existing buildings, which suggests income generated from the nearby mines. Figure 4.7: Construction and additions on buildings from 2021-09-12 to 2022-04-15 (34.95419, 70.81488) Copyright Maxar  Mawi Figure 5.0: Overview of the Mawi and Kolum mining area 2022-04-15 (35.201, 70.335) Copyright Maxar  Historical background The Mawi pegmatite is part of an area with several gem-bearing pegmatites discovered by Soviet geologists in the 1970s. The Soviets hired local men to search for lithium, cesium, and other elements for military purposes.24 The Mawi pegmatite measures 1.5 kilometers long and contains pockets of giant kunzite crystals that can yield tons of material per pocket. Thousands of kilograms of kunzite can be extracted annually. This kunzite is cut and shaped then sold to collectors.24 Approximately 1.5 kilometers away from Mawi is another site called the Kolum pegmatite which also yields various crystals for collectors.24 Crystals from Mawi and Kolum sell for thousands of dollars on the collector's market.25 Mining background Open reporting is limited regarding the mining background outside the core drilling and blasting under the direction of the Soviets in the 1970s.24 Ground photography26 suggests current mining likely consists of various adits with white crystalline tailings and spoil piles outside of the adits. Electrical wiring is noted extending into one of the audits in the ground photography, which is likely providing electricity for power tools and lighting. Mining baseline From 2018-04-30 to 2019-07-31, the majority of the buildings near the main Mawi mine deteriorated or were destroyed. However, two or three buildings were rebuilt or had roofs restored (see Figure 5.1). Limited spoil pile and tailings growth suggest limited mining activity. No vehicles were observed in the imagery. At the Kolum mine, some buildings were observed but the low imagery resolution makes it difficult to identify any changes to the buildings. There is one new mine tailing indicating new mining activity during this time period (see Figure 5.2). There are no significant nearby villages to help establish a village baseline. Figure 5.2: New tailings and mining activity appearing at the Kolum mine between 2018-04-30 and 2019-07-31 (35.20711, 70.34866) Copyright Maxar  Mining changes and analysis Between 2019-07-31 and 2021-09-05, substantial change was observed. By 2021, a graded road leading up to the Mawi mine and four vehicles parked near the top of the mine were observed. Four new buildings were built or restored, with construction started on several others (see Figure 5.3). Several new tailings formed on the south side of the Mawi mine and also toward the Kolum mine, indicating new mining activity. At the Kolum mine, new clearer imagery showed several deteriorated buildings next to the main mining area (see Figure 5.4). Building activity greatly accelerated between 2021-09-05 and 2022-04-15 at both mines. At Mawi over 16 buildings were built in those months and foundations were laid for several more (see Figures 5.5 ). Several new tailings indicate new mines (see Figure 5.6). At Kolum, three new buildings were built in those months and three old buildings were rebuilt with new roofs. Some of the mine tailings have expanded, indicating that there is new mining activity (see Figure 5.7). Figure 5.4: Deteriorated buildings at the Kolum mining area seen in imagery from 2021-09-15 (35.20828, 70.34944) Copyright Maxar  Figure 5.7: New buildings, restored roofs, and expanding mine tailings at the Kolum site from 2021-09-08 and 2022-04-15 (35.20817, 70.34932) Copyright Maxar  Paprok Figure 6.0: Overview of the Paprok mining area 2019-09-18 (35.62528, 71.16789) Copyright Maxar  Historical background Fine tourmaline crystals were first discovered in the mountains northwest of the village of Paprok in 1969. Following the initial discovery in the 1970s, large tourmaline crystals from the area started reaching western collectors and mineral dealers. The entire area is mountainous with peaks reaching up to 5800 meters. The nearest village is Paprok, approximately 16 kilometers from the mining area. Production at the site depends on the weather and the availability of dynamite.27 It is unknown if recent bans on dynamite sales have affected mining because there are no reports from the area since 2017 and there is no usable imagery more recent than 2019. Tourmaline crystals from the site are in demand and can reach the low five figures collector's markets. 28 Mining background The mines consist of adits excavated into cliffsides. Some of the tunnels can are over 200 meters long. Approximately 100 people work in teams and often live inside the mines for up to 10 days at a time.29 Little has been written about mining at the site since 2017 but according to mineral experts, there could be as many as 300 individual mines in the area.30 Baselines Figure 6.2: Mine with tailings, showing possible expansion of mine, but may be an artifact of steep terrain and camera angles, from 2017-09-28 and 2019-09-18 (35.63577, 71.17266) Copyright Maxar  Nilaw Figure 7.0: Overview of the Nilaw mining area 2019-07-31 (35.23719, 70.28885) Copyright Maxar  Historical and mining background The Nilaw pegmatite is a sub-set of the Mawi pegmatite. There is little open historical information on the site. The pegmatite was discovered and surveyed by Soviet geologists in the 1970s. Pockets of tourmaline were found as recently as 2008.31 Large tailings extending from mining sites stretched out over a kilometer suggest significant mining took place but GEOINT analysis shows no substantial mining activity at the Nilaw site in recent times. Baseline From 2017-07-08 to 2019-07-31 there were no changes to the mine or tailings. This suggests no significant mining activity (see Figure 7.1). The nearby village had few changes; only one new building and additions\/improvements to three building complexes (see Figure 7.2). Figure 7.2: Local village near Nilaw on 2019-07-31 (35.23719, 70.29689) Copyright Maxar  Mining changes and analysis Unlike most of the other mining sites mentioned previously, there were no changes at Nilaw in recent imagery. As with the baseline, more recent imagery from 2019-07-31 to 2022-04-23 showed no significant change to the mining area. Some of the tailings appear longer but this is likely due to erosion bringing material downhill (see Figure 7.3). There are no new mine-related buildings or infrastructure. There are no changes to the village. Figure 7.3: Tailings became longer between 2019-07-31 and 2022-04-23 but it may just be due to erosion rather than mining (35.23859, 70.29211) Copyright Maxar  US Market and Social Media Historically, significant quantities of Lapis Lazuli made their way to western markets by crossing the border to Pakistan rather than going through Kabul.32 Lapis Lazuli often appears in US markets from Pakistani mineral and gemstone dealers attending trade shows, specifically in Tucson Arizona where a large show takes place in late January and early February annually. In 2022, the selling of Lapis Lazuli continues at the Tucson shows with four different Pakistani dealers each bringing an estimated 500-1000 kilograms of Lapis Lazuli in trunks to sell at rented booths. The price of Lapis Lazuli in 2022 is $150 per kilogram, which is similar to previous years.33 Figure 8.1: Lapis Lazuli from Sar-e Sang at the Tucson mineral show in 2022 from a Pakistani dealer. Photo by Justin Z - February 2022.  With the rise of social media, many dealers overseas sell directly to clients instead of wholesale buyers. On Instagram, there are dozens of mineral dealers located in Pakistan who sell minerals from Afghanistan with tourmalines and emeralds being the most popular.

The following sites should be imaged with high-resolution imagery multiple times a year during their mining seasons. Imagery signatures include new mine tailings, spoil piles, mining buildings, roads, and additions in local villages.SAR imagery could supplement electro-optical imagery searches to find mining portals which often can be difficult to see with electro-optical imagery, especially for areas like Paprok, where the mining season is short and the cloud cover is significant. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/centers\/land-subsidence-in-california\/science\/interferometric-synthetic-aperture-radar-insar\">InSAR<\/a>) could also be useful in determining changes in elevation by measuring the shifting height of spoil piles.In addition to SAR, multispectral imagery exploitation demonstrated in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/action\/showCitFormats?doi=10.1080%2F10106049.2020.1716394\">2022 at Panjshir<\/a> that emeralds can be located and mapped with spectral signatures.

{"article":"The Ice Curtain_ Protecting the Arctic Motherland.json","text":"Arctic  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors The Ice Curtain: Protecting the Arctic Motherland  In partnership with \n CSIS \n and written by \n Heather Conley, \n Matthew Melino, \n and Joseph Bermudez  Latest weapons pad construction Impact more layered Arctic defenses Published Apr 23 2019 3\u00a0years, 8\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  A complex layered coastal defense arrangement on Kotelny Island allows Russia to better defend and to deny aerial, maritime, or land access to NATO or U.S. forces.  It also demonstrates Russian sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction over the Northern Sea Route (NSR) at a time when the Kremlin actively seeks international investment to develop the route. Activity Weapons pad construction for improved readiness is a major GEOINT theme in this report.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  The Issue Russian military officials recently invited international journalists to tour the newly refurbished Arctic Temp airbase on Kotelny Island, one of the largest of the New Siberian Islands, situated off the northern Siberian coast. In the past, Russian bases were closed to outside observers, but the Russian government appears eager to show the international community its modern air defense infrastructure and capabilities prior to Russia's annual International Arctic Forum. In addition to Temp airbase, Kotelny is equipped with a state-of-the-art trefoil military compound; communications and Sopka-2 radar facilities; and pads for radar, command and control, and missile launch vehicles. Kotelny is a central element in Russia's growing network of Arctic islands that create a protective dome around its coastline and includes key outposts, such as Wrangel Island. Along with active Russian sub-surface vessels, new anti-air and anti-ship capabilities on Kotelny represent a robust anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) bubble in the Arctic, which could limit NATO and U.S. air and maritime capabilities in the region. Introduction During the Cold War, Moscow maintained a military observation post and radar station on Kotelny but it, along with other derelict Arctic outposts, was largely abandoned after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. But in 2013, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that it was redeveloping Kotelny Island as part of a larger effort to reestablish a regular naval presence in the Arctic. Increased maritime patrols would safeguard Russia's territorial waters and extensive Arctic coastline, protect mineral and energy resources, and monitor shipping along the Northern Sea Route. Principal among these naval assets its Northern Fleet, the Kremlin's most visible and powerful fleet in the Arctic which includes its sea-based nuclear deterrent and sub-surface vessels that now frequently patrol the region and the North Atlantic. The Kremlin has also enhanced its naval aviation assets in the region and is actively exercising its new Arctic capabilities, flying over 100 Arctic sorties in 2018 of reconnaissance, maritime patrol, and anti-submarine aircraft. The Northern Fleets air and air defense units engaged in 2,700 firing exercises including 51 missile launches in 2017, and 148 exercises in 2018 accompanied by 157 rocket launches. These exercises increasingly rehearse Russia's complex and combined operations while testing its ability to mobilize rapidly to defend its Arctic coastline. It is for these reasons that Russia's growing suite of integrated air and missile defense assets in the Arctic, to include the deployment of Bastion-P coastal defense system equipped with supersonic P-800 Oniks\/Yakhont anti-ship cruise missiles, must be assessed for its defense implications to the U.S. and NATO. The 15 satellite images examined between 2013-2019, show a concerted program was undertaken since 2014 to construct at least eight and potentially as many as eleven specialized weapons pads along the Kotelny coastline and at Temp Airbase. These weapons pads are used by radar, command and control, and missile launch vehicles and are uniquely pyramidal in shape, elevated above the tundra for drainage and stability. These pads vary in size and are now being used to support the Bastion-P coastal defense missile system and other air and coastal defense missile systems. Only those satellite images dating from September 2018 show direct evidence of the deployment of the Bastion-P on Kotelny Island, which corroborates Russian reporting of the systems delivery to the island at that time. This construction effort clearly indicates a logical and well-planned Russian project over the past five years to develop air and maritime defenses of an important Arctic island base. Russian military facilities on Kotelny Island with the pads for radar, command and control and missile launch vehicles highlighted, August 7, 2018 (Courtesy European Space Agency). Why the Kotelny Bastion-P Deployment is Important A major upgrade to Russian Arctic coastal defense capabilities (on Kotelny and by extension the Northern Fleet) occurred during 2018 when at least a battery-sized unit of K-300P Bastion-P (NATO reporting name SS-C-5 Stooge) coastal defense missiles were deployed to Kotelny by sea.1 The Bastion-P system is a modern coastal defense missile system that employs the supersonic P-800 Oniks\/Yakhont (NATO reporting name SS-N-26 Strobile) anti-ship cruise missile. The P-800 has a maximum range of 300 km and is significantly more modern and more capable than the older 4K51 Rubezh system (NATO reporting name SSC-3 Styx), a longer-range dedicated coastal defense cruise missile system.2 The two large weapons pads constructed at Temp Airbase during 2017 as seen on September 25, 2018, the day before the live firing exercise. The large unoccupied weapons pad midpoint along the runway of Temp Airbase during 2017, the day prior to the live firing exercise, September 25, 2018. The large weapons pad at the southwest end of Temp Airbase showing two Bastion-P TELs and a command and control vehicle the day before the live firing exercise, September 25, 2018. Two Bastion-P TELs subsequently took part in a live-firing exercise on September 26, 2018 as part of the larger Vostok-2018, considered the largest Russian military exercise since the end of the Cold War.3 It was also the first known live-fire test of the system by the Northern Fleet, which mobilized across the Northern Sea Route to participate in the exercises in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. Commander of the Northern Fleet, Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov stated that \"the crew of the Bastion coastal missile system successfully carried out missile firing at a naval target position [in the Laptev Sea] at a range of over 60 kilometers to prove its readiness to effectively fulfill combat duty in the Arctic and protect the island area and the sea coast of Russia.\"4 Both satellite imagery and ground footage released by the Russian Ministry of Defense show that the Bastion-P launchers and a command and control vehicle were positioned on the weapons pad at the southwest end of Temp Airbase for the exercise. A view looking northeast at the two Bastion-P TELs deployed on the large weapons pad at Temp Airbase for a live-firing exercise.

The unoccupied weapons pad midpoint along the runway of Temp Airbase seen on March 8, 2019. The Bastion-P system is a significant upgrade to Russia's Arctic coastal defense system. While its range is limited and its location on Kotelny Island poses no immediate threat to U.S. or neighboring countries, the Bastion-P system projects Russian sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction over the Northern Sea Route (NSR) at a time when the Kremlin is actively seeking international investment to develop the route. The positioning of more robust capabilities could also be in anticipation of a future Russian assertion of jurisdiction over its proposed extended outer continental shelf claims, which are currently under review by the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. Moreover, these enhanced capabilities support Russia's assertion that the NSR is an internal, rather than an international passage. A January statement from U.S. Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer that the U.S. Navy will consider a freedom of navigation operation (FONOP) in the Arctic could be viewed by the Kremlin as justification for a military response. In an ominous and possibly foreshadowing comment, President Putin recently stated that he \"wouldn't like to see the Arctic turning into something like Crimea...due to our failure to take timely measures.\" The Making of Kotelny During the first two weeks of September 2013, a Russian Navy flotilla offloaded personnel, heavy engineering equipment and material to begin construction of the new base on Kotelny. Aside from housing and support facilities, contemporaneous reports state that among the facilities to be constructed were an air command unit, medical center, satellite communications facility, naval dock, and a 2,500 meter airfield (then scheduled to be completed by the end of October) subsequently identified as the Temp Airbase.5 All of this was reported to be under the control of the Northern Fleets newly established 99th Arctic Tactical Group.6 The administration and housing trefoil on Kotelny Island, March 15, 2019. A March 15, 2019 overview of the Kotelny communications facility, Sopka-2 radar installation and the twin weapons pads. A closeup view of the communications facility, Sopka-2 radar installation, March 15, 2019. The first mention of any air or coastal defense missile systems deployed to Kotelny occurred during the Vostok-2014 exercise when Russian media announced that a Pantsir-S1 coastal missile system [based on Kotelny] opened fire [and] successfully hit a Termit air cruise missile target and proved their readiness to protect Russia's northern borders.7 The Pantsir-S1 (NATO reporting name SA-22 Greyhound) is a short-range point defense system capable of engaging aircraft, UAVs and cruise missiles. Subsequent reports indicate that a battalion level unit equipped with the system was assigned to the 99th Arctic Tactical Group.8 Satellite imagery from 2013-2014, shows that none of the unique pyramidal weapons pads for the system had yet been constructed. Within a year the Pantsir-S1 on Kotelny was augmented by a unit equipped with the SSC-3 Styx coastal defense missile system.9 Satellite imagery shows that the first of the unique weapons pads, the twin complex 1.8 kilometers southwest of the housing and administration trefoil, was constructed during September 2015. It is likely that it was from here that both Pantsir-S1 and the older SSC-3 Styx systems participated in a live firing exercise later that month.10 A closeup view of the twin weapons pads as seen on March 15, 2019. These were the first of the unique pyramidal weapons pads constructed on Kotelny Island. During September-December 2015 three additional weapons pads were built in an area three kilometers northwest of the housing and administration trefoil. This was followed by the early 2016 construction of a conjoined weapons pad 4.7 kilometers northwest of the housing and administration trefoil. Construction of two large weapons pads on Temp Airbase subsequently took place during mid-2017. Concurrently three additional weapons pads were constructed further inland, in a rectangular-shaped pattern, approximately 3.7 kilometers north of the housing and administration trefoil.11 The three weapons pads constructed during late-2015 three kilometers northwest of the administration and housing trefoil, March 15, 2019. A fourth pad that was built during 2017 is seen at the left of the image. Closeup view of the conjoined weapons pads, March 8, 2018. Again, both the Pantsir-S1 and SSC-3 Styx systems participated in live-fire exercises during 2016 and 2017.12 These firing exercises were conducted from the new weapons pads along the coast and at Temp Airbase. Satellite imagery from August 31, 2017 supports this assessment as three Pantsir-S1 transporter-erector-launchers (TEL) were observed at the northernmost weapons pad. A view through clouds at three Pantsir-S1 TELs and a command post vehicle on the conjoined weapons pad on August 31, 2017. Weapons pads on Kotelny (as of March 2019) A Growing and More Effective Russian Military Presence in the Arctic During the Cold War, the Soviet Union viewed the Arctic as essential to its survivability: protection of its sub-surface strategic nuclear deterrent preserved second-strike capability while also deterring an attack. Twenty-eight years later, Russia's military presence on Kotelny Island demonstrates a complex layered coastal defense arrangement which include Temp Airbase, the Sopka-2 radar system, and the Bastion-P and Pantsir-S1 coastal defense systems. Temp Airbase is not a minor installation; its length and size mean its capable of accommodating large cargo planes such as Il-76 for significant reinforcement. The Sopka-2 radar is part of a larger network covering the entirety of Russia's northern border with penetration capabilities deeper into the central Arctic as seen on Russia's most easterly facing Arctic island, Wrangel Island. As a cuing radar, the Sopka-2 collects data and intelligence to detect activity emanating toward the north. That data could be used to improve Russian domain awareness or direct surface-to-air missiles or guns to engage aircraft or cruise missiles. The addition of the Pantsir-S1 coastal defense system and the accompanying weapons pads reinforce Russia's intent to defend its Arctic territory against foreign aircraft, UAVs, or cruise missiles, along with anti-ship systems (SSC-3 Styx and Bastion-P). Significant Russian improvements in its Arctic air and coastal defense over the past several years underscore its view of the Arctic as a tactical war-fighting domain. In addition to the regions role in Russia's broader nuclear deterrent strategy, the Arctic is now a region to defend and to deny aerial, maritime, or land access to NATO or U.S. forces. Russia's efforts to secure its Arctic territory and coastline through improved air defense capabilities are vital stepping stones to minimize its perceived defense vulnerabilities in the North.

{"article":"Part I_ Analyzing Chinas Continued Expansion of Coal-Fired Power Capacity.json","text":"Climate Change  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Part I: Analyzing China's Continued Expansion of Coal-Fired Power Capacity  In partnership with \n Columbia University \n and written by \n Capstone Team, Class of 2021  Latest coal plant growth during COVID Impact coal's impact on carbon neutrality goals Published Jun 29 2021 1\u00a0year, 6\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  In September 2020, against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic and with the global economy still reeling, China pledged that it would achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. In this two-part series, researchers from the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs explore China's progress towards that goal along two vectors: \"brown\" and \"green\". Part I (\"brown\") identifies 5 coal-fired power plants, approved in March 2020, and tracks their construction and continued development. Activity Analysis of electro-optical satellite imagery, open satellite radar data, ground photography, and online literature illustrates that the development of coal-fired power plants continued throughout 2020, despite nationwide construction slowdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic and the country's stated climate change objectives. Article  Timeline  Introduction On September 22, 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping made a historic pledge to the United Nations General Assembly: by 2060, China, the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, would achieve carbon neutrality. The goal itself was ambitious but equally remarkable was the timing of the speech, made with the world still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic, President Xi tied his pledge to the crisis, imploring the international community to achieve a green recovery of the world economy in the post-COVID era. As governments worldwide have deployed stimulus and other measures to bolster economic activity, this green recovery aspiration would be put to the test. The EU, for example, declared that the Post-COVID-19 Europe will be greener, more digital, more resilient, while the United States was largely agnostic to climate change concerns in its early stimulus efforts. Would China's efforts be brown, green, or both? Using commercial imagery (electro-optical) and open radar data, and with the coronavirus as a backdrop, this two-part series explores China's progress towards its own carbon goals. First, we examine how the construction of coal-fired power plants has continued across the country during the COVID-19 pandemic, even as the coronavirus pandemic slowed down most construction activities. Next, we analyze China's progress in its afforestation efforts. The greenest of green measures, China's ambitious tree-planting programs were originally designed for anti-desertification and anti-soil-erosion purposes. Today, the technique has been tied to climate goals due to the perceived carbon sink benefits of forests. Coal Power Development in China Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, coal has fundamentally fueled the country's growth and development. Today, China is the world's largest producer, consumer, and importer of coal. At its peak, coal supported more than 70% of China's total energy needs.1 Over the last two decades, however, China's coal consumption as a percentage of its overall energy portfolio has waned, a function of the country's increasing reliance on renewable energy sources.2,3 Accordingly, coal has dropped to around 57% of China's energy mix, and utilization rates have dipped at coal plants across China, passing below 50% in 2015. Built Capacity Additions and Utilization in China's Coal Plants Source: China Electricity Council, CREA, EMBER.  The Roots of China's Coal-Power Overcapacity and the Traffic Light Policy The end result has been overcapacity in Chinese coal: more new plants, operating at lower rates. China's coal-power overcapacity can be traced to the late 2000s and early 2010s. In response to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, China's stimulus program extended cheap credit for new plants and allowed provinces to approve new builds.4, 5 An overwhelming surge in coal plants prompted new policies to rein in coal development, but results were mixed at best. A new Traffic Light System meant to cut down on new coal in certain provinces was mostly ineffective, as the number of provinces receiving green light ratings--able to build coal without restrictions--increased from 2016 to 2019.6 COVID-19 only accelerated this trend. From January to June 2020, provinces awarded permits to 17.0 GW of new plants; by the end of 2020, new permits had reached 36.9 GW, more than the prior three years combined, per a new monitoring report by Global Energy Monitor, CREA, Sierra Club, Climate Risk Horizons, GreenID, and Eskosfer.7 Additionally, since the start of the pandemic, China further relaxed the risk ratings of its traffic light rules, giving the green light to all but six regions.8, 9 Together, this data tentatively suggests that during the pandemic, China turned to coal to stimulate the domestic economy.10 However, this does not tell the whole story: receiving a permit or approval does not mean that actual construction began or was continued during the COVID and post-COVID periods. To corroborate a possible uptick in China's coal buildout during 2020, we utilize commercial satellite imagery and open radar data analyzed within Google Earth Engine, to see if the approved projects commenced and proceeded as planned during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article identifies and analyzes five plants that were approved\/permitted in March 2020, including four new construction projects (Sites 1 - 4) and one upgraded and expanded existing project (Site 5). Sites were selected where sufficient imagery and data were available. Though our imagery analysis cannot speak to buildout across all of China, it does indicate that coal construction proceeded rapidly at these plants during 2020, pointing to at least localized coal build-outs during China's economic stimulus campaign. To examine these sites, we use two tools. First, we deploy 1) an activity and change alerting and detection service created within Google Earth Engine, using open synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected by Sentinel-1. This SAR activity\/change service works by detecting changes in radar backscatter over time caused by moving vehicles, construction activity, or natural phenomena. We supplement SAR activity tracking with commercial electro-optical imagery analysis. SAR activity detection script running inside Google Earth Engine. The red spots show increased general activity from radar backscatter over time. Readers will see these red activity spots throughout this report.  In addition to red spots to highlight activity, general radar activity can also be shown with time series plots. The y-axis is measured in decibels (dB), or overall backscatter signal strength, while the x-axis shows time.  Site 1: Diantou Town Baishi Village, Siwan Village (Lat: 35.657848, Lon: 109.050538) Satellite imagery indicates that within only one month land was completely flattened for the construction of the Diantou power plant. Fresh tracks are visible in the March 2020 image but are completely absent when compared to imagery from only one month prior, in February 2020. Additionally, the SAR data from Sentinel-1 indicates activity at the site surged between March 2020 and June 2020 around the time when the permit was granted. More simply, the SAR script is likely detecting early post-permit activity at the site such as vehicle movement, surveying, and other building activity. Copyright 2020 DigitalGlobe  Source: Huangling Mining Group website  Site 2: Shanxi Fu County Power Station Unit 1 (Lat: 35.858656, Lon: 109.2167) As seen in the electro-optical satellite imagery from December 2019 to July 2020, the west-tail power plant has expanded. New cooling towers were developed in the northeast area of the east-tail power plant to meet the water supply demand for air-cooled, coal-fired facilities. Roads were also built in the northeast area for future project development. Additionally, SAR data indicates activity at the site surged starting in March 2020, corroborating the electro-optical imagery analysis. The SAR script detected medium activity around permit time in March 2020 then a sharp spike in September 2020, which is likely a heavier construction phase. Copyright 2019 and 2020 DigitalGlobe  Site 3: Yanghuopan Power Station (Lat: 39.052543, Lon: 110.519944) From August 2019 to January 2021, this project has made significant construction progress. Two cooling towers and corresponding support facilities were built from the old site. A highway on the west side of the plant was constructed and opened to traffic. The project also expanded to the east, reflected by the newly-built groundwork for power plants and interconnected roads. Once again, the SAR detected activity around and after permit time in March and May 2020, then heavier construction activity after August 2020. Copyright 2021 DigitalGlobe  Copyright DigitalGlobe 2021 and ground photo source, siluchina.com.cn  Site 4: CPI Baiyinhua Power Station (Lat: 44.804701, Long: 118.513627) Using electro-optical imagery from January 2020 to January 2021, we found this project made significant progress in construction, and radar data corroborates the construction of two cooling towers with corresponding support facilities. Again, as with the aforementioned sites, the SAR script indicates a significant increase in activity at the site beginning in March 2020 and a rise throughout 2020. Copyright 2020 DigitalGlobe  Site 5: Fugu Qingshuichuan power station (Lat: 39.203699, Long: 111.117694) Electro-optical imagery analysis confirms the first stage of the construction for the expansion of new units or sections possibly began in March 2020 and ended in April 2020, and SAR data from Sentinel-1, which indicates an increase in activity during that time frame, corroborates the electro-optical imagery findings. The electro-optical images also confirm land was cleared for construction purposes between August 2019 and September 2020. SAR data (via the SAR script) also shows a second uptick in activity from February 2021 well into March 2021. This could indicate a second phase of construction of the expansion projects. The drop in activity in late 2020 with an uptick in early 2021 is unique compared to the other sites. Conclusion All five coal sites have seen significant construction progress since March 2020. Though our analysis does not preclude the possibility that China promoted a green recovery from COVID-19 in other ways in 2020, it does indicate that COVID-19 had little impact in slowing the buildout of coal-fired power plants at these sites, which represent a significant expansion of coal-fired power capacity. This coal buildout and the major coal approvals in March of 2020 stand in tension with China's long-term climate goals, and these five coal power plants will have a meaningful negative impact on China's ability to achieve its 2060 pledge of carbon neutrality. This is especially true given China's current Five Year Plan (14th FYP, 2021-2025), which aims for green transformation but is short on some specifics and nominally commits to the continued use of \"clean\" coal. Reaching China's more ambitious targets will likely take more extensive emissions reductions and action on coal power, including aggressive retirement of coal-fired power capacity. SAR Tool Summary Permit and construction progress is often gleaned from press releases, company filings, trade group updates, and other unstructured reporting. While valuable, these reports can often be outdated, incomplete, or hard to find. The SAR script\/tool developed for this project within Google Earth Engine assists us in developing consistent and objective alerts on construction timelines and activity spikes or declines programmatically and at scale (all-weather revisit time from radar imagery is often higher than electro-optical imagery).

{"article":"Chinese Maritime Expansion and Potential Dual-Use Implications on Critical Maritime Chokepoints.json","text":"China's Belt and Road Initiative  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Chinese Maritime Expansion and Potential Dual-Use Implications on Critical Maritime Chokepoints  In partnership with \n Johns Hopkins University \n and written by \n Zachary Hutchings  Latest 17 Ports Analyzed Impact Possible Denial of Sea Space Published Jul 20 2021 1\u00a0year, 5\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  Though Chinese \"Belt-and-Road Initiative\" (BRI) investments and related economic activities abroad have been a touchpoint for international studies, this report poses a hypothetical \"what if\" scenario and seeks to address one facet of the potential implications if Chinese facilities abroad are used for dual-use military\/civilian purposes. The current strategic environment has placed the United States and its allies on a seemingly inexorable path towards confrontation with the People\u2019s Republic of China. Given the close relationship between Chinese corporations and military entities, based on the concept of Military-Civil Fusion, this report addresses the hypothetical implications of the military use of seventeen civilian (BRI related) ports with respect to eight identified critical maritime chokepoints. Activity To accomplish the goals stated above, an analysis of open source imagery to assess the type of threats that could be hosted at seventeen BRI ports utilizing both military and civilian shipping as transport has been conducted. The implications and extent of these threats have been graphically superimposed over maps of strategic sea routes to visually reinforce the extent of the potential future strategic obstacles. Consequently, it is assessed that Chinese BRI developments could theoretically pose a threat to seven of eight identified critical maritime chokepoints. However, as a caveat to this conclusion, there are a multitude of factors that serve as obstacles to the realization of this hypothetical end-state. Article  Timeline  1. Key Intelligence Question In the event of a Great Power Conflict, what Chinese maritime investments and developments abroad potentially threaten U.S. and Allied maritime capability via the reinforcement and denial of sea space immediately surrounding critical maritime chokepoints? 2. Key Judgement It is currently assessed that the pre-placement of threat capabilities at the identified Belt and Road Initiative-related maritime infrastructures would enable the PRC to deny freedom of navigation to U.S and Allied maritime activities via all of the identified critical maritime chokepoints, with the exception of the Panama Canal. 3. Framing the Discussion 3.1 The Underlying Trend: The Thucydides Trap.1 Thucydides, in the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War, stated, \"what made the war inevitable was the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta.\"2 Ultimately, his statement has come to represent the idea put forward by Harvard Professor Graham Allison, that \"rising powers tend to come into conflict with those whose strength is long established.\"3 Indeed, so powerful is this concept that in 2015 President Xi Jinping stated \"There is no such thing as the so-called Thucydides trap in the world.\" But should major countries time and again make the mistakes of strategic miscalculation, they might create such traps for themselves.\"4 In the same speech Xi Jinping states, \"We want to see more understanding and trust, less estrangement and suspicion, in order to forestall misunderstanding and miscalculation.\" However, in an earlier speech, from 2013, Xi Jinping notes that \"in the economic, technological, and military domains\" his country would need to prepare for \"a long period of cooperation and of conflict\" with the expressed aim of \"building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and laying the foundation for a future where we will win the initiative and have the dominant position.\"5 To understand the full dynamics of this strategic situation, it is important to comprehend the extent of the factors in play. 3.2 The Strategic Environment In 2018, the United States Department of Defense's (DOD) National Defense Strategy stated that the \"re-emergence of long-term, strategic competition between nations\" has driven the realization that \"inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security.\"6 Specifically, \"long-term strategic competitions with China and Russia are the principal priorities.\"7 It goes on to elaborate that, \"China is leveraging military modernization, influence operations, and predatory economics to coerce neighboring countries to reorder the Indo-Pacific region to their advantage.\"8 However, beyond the Indo-Pacific region, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is pursuing a course of expansion that threatens the key US defense objectives of: 1. \"Sustaining Joint Force military advantages, both globally and in key regions\" 2. \"Maintaining favorable regional balances of power in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and the Western Hemisphere,\" and 3. \"Ensuring common domains remain open and free.\"9 The PRC potentially threatens these objectives via a program of infrastructure expansion it began in 2013. 3.3 Chinese Expansion: The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), originally referred to as the \"One Belt, One Road Initiative,\" began in 2013 following an announcement by President Xi Jinping. The initiative consists of two distinct efforts: the Silk Road Economic Belt, and the Maritime Silk Road.10 According to President Xi Jinping, the BRI will \"strengthen cooperation with countries along the land and maritime Silk Roads, so as to jointly build an open platform for cooperation and create new impetus to achieve sustainable development in the related regions.\"11 The Silk Road Economic Belt is primarily aimed at land-based infrastructure to facilitate international trade with China and globally expand Chinese economic influence throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa. A flagship example of this effort is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). According to the Chairman of Chinese National Development and Reform Commission, Mr. He Lifeng, CPEC seeks to \"improve the region's infrastructure, and put in place a secure and efficient network of land, sea and air passages, lifting their connectivity to a higher level; further enhance trade and investment facilitation, establish a network of free trade areas that meet high standards, maintain closer economic ties, and deepen political trust.\"12 Similar to this Economic Belt, as a complementary effort, the PRC is pursuing a global network of maritime ventures designed to achieve the same objective via \"jointly building smooth, secure and efficient transport routes connecting major seaports along the Belt and Road.\"13 This expansion effort should not be confused with PRC expansion into the South China Sea via their \"Nine Dash Line\" proclamation, which is a different political movement, though one which is potentially an equal indicator of future intent. Fundamental to the BRI's concept is President Xi Jinping's stance that \"China will continue to pursue win-win cooperation and enhance friendship and cooperation with other countries.\"14 The concept of \"win-win\" relationships implies that both countries will achieve some sort of windfall at the completion of mutual endeavors. Therein lies the contentious interpretation of the BRI's purpose. While BRI may be portrayed as an economic \"win-win,\" many skeptics believe the relationship to be coercive between China and the nations it supports through BRI investments. C4ADS summarizes this notion in a related analysis by stating \"with over one-third of the BRI participant countries vulnerable to debt distress, unfavorable deals can put a country at an economic disadvantage, endowing China with outsized leverage over its partner.\"15 Though BRI is a state-sponsored program of expansion, the individual actors for the BRI are the network of Chinese companies conducting individual business deals with nations around the globe. 3.4 Understanding Chinese Corporate Players: Unlike Western contemporaries, the majority of Chinese corporations are very closely tied to the Chinese State. To succeed, the BRI relies on Chinese corporations to operate in a semi-autonomous fashion to pursue ventures ultimately aimed at supporting the overall goals of the nation. Several Chinese companies have major roles in the BRI. Their roles will be described throughout the rest of this report, specifically: China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC), COSCO Shipping Holdings (COSCO), China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPort), China Overseas Port Holding Group (COPHC), and Landbridge Group. CCCC was founded in 2006 as a state-run enterprise and claims to be \"the largest port construction and design company in China, a leading company in road and bridge construction and design, a leading railway construction company, the largest dredging company in China and the second-largest dredging company (in terms of dredging capacity) in the world. [CCCC] is also the world's largest container crane manufacturer.\"16 Notably, CCCC played a significant role in the construction of the contentious Paracel and Spratly Island infrastructure.17 Via its subsidiary organizations, CCCC has played a major role in the development of several overseas locations of interest. COPHC, a subsidiary of CCCC, is the governing authority for the development of Pakistan's Gwadar Port,18 which is an integral part of CPEC. CHEC, also a subsidiary of CCCC, \"has been developing and operating overseas business on behalf of CCCC [...] in over 80 countries throughout the world,\" and operates primarily in the \"Engineering-Procurement-Construction (EPC), Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), and Private-Public-Partnership (PPP)\" sectors. In addition to land-based infrastructure, CHEC has construction roles in the development of the ports at El-Hamdania, Sokhna, Colombo, and Hambantota in Algeria, Egypt, and Sri Lanka respectively.19 CMPort, a subsidiary of the state-owned China Merchants Group,20 owns or operates portions of the ports of Colombo (Sri Lanka), Hambantota (Sri Lanka), Doraleh (Djibouti), and Kumport (Turkey).21\u00a0Perhaps more significantly, but beyond the scope of this analysis, in 2013 CMPort acquired a 49% operational stake in Terminal Link, a joint venture with the French firm CMA-CGM. According to the press release, \"Terminal Link owns 15 container terminals in 8 countries across four major continents\" to include: the Belgian ports at Zeebrugge and Antwerp, the French ports at Dunkirk, Le Havre, Montoir, and Fos, the Moroccan ports at Casablanca and Tangier, the American ports at Houston and Miami, the South Korean port at Busan, the Maltese port at Marsaxlokk, and the Ivorian port at Abidjan.22 Additionally, China Merchants Group, through its subsidiary, China Merchants Energy Shipping, and via their (China Merchants Energy Shipping) subsidiary CSC RoRo Logistics Ltd., \"operates a fleet of 25 car carriers and large transshipment depots around the country.\"23 Finally, following a 2017 merger China Merchants Group acquired the subsidiary Sinotrans & CSC Co. Ltd. which specializes in logistics and freight shipping.24 COSCO is arguably the most wide-reaching of all Chinese maritime industries. COSCO Shipping Holdings is a state-run company which \"is mainly engaged in domestic and international maritime container transport services and related businesses.\"25 According to COSCO, as of 2020 they, \"owned and operated 536 container vessels with a total capacity of 3.1 million TEUs, ranking 3rd place in the world in terms of shipping capacity.\"26 In addition to container transportation, COSCO Shipping Specialized Carriers Co. Ltd. operates a fleet of special use vessels, to include multi-purpose, heavy lift, semi-submersible, and specialized car carriers.27 Besides this extensive capacity for shipping, COSCO also operates an extensive network of port facilities, with terminals in Seattle (USA), Chancay (Peru), Zeebrugge (Belgium), Antwerp (Belgium), Bilbao and Valencia (Spain), Vado (Italy), Piraeus (Greece), Kumport (Turkey), Abu Dhabi (UAE), Busan (Korea), and Singapore.28 In addition to being an extensive list of locations, the similarity of locations between CMPort ventures and COSCO terminals indicates possible cooperation amongst Chinese maritime companies. While all these companies can be directly tied to the Chinese state, Landbridge Group, a privately owned company based in Rizhao, China, has also played a significant role in China's overseas expansion, although perhaps to a lesser extent than explicitly state-owned enterprises. That said, a 2015 photo documents Landbridge's founder, Ye Cheng, receiving a congratulatory handshake from Chinese President Xi Jinping following Landbridge's 2015 acquisition of a 99-year lease to operate Darwin Port in Australia,29 indicating a potential degree of government supervision or cooperation. Landbridge's main acquisitions, as mentioned, are the purchase of the port in Darwin, Australia30 as well as the purchase and ongoing development of the Panama Colon Container Port, at the Caribbean entrance to the Panama Canal.31 Although Landbridge Group is a privately owned company based in China, the relationship between Chinese corporations and the state is distinctly different compared to western norms. Image 3.1: Landbridge Group Founder Ye Cheng and PRC President Xi Jinping in 2015  3.5 Chinese Civil-Military Relationship: China has long operated under the fundamental concept of Civil-Military Integration (CMI). CMI is \"a process combining defense and civilian industrial bases to support military and commercial demands.\"31 Consequently, the corporate structure of Chinese business differs considerably from western societies. Specifically, where a western business must follow the rules of their government but, in most cases, is not strictly subservient to that government, Chinese businesses operate in a more controlled business sphere. In 2015, President Xi Jinping expanded on the concept of CMI, with a new concept, Military-Civil Fusion (MCF) when he stated: \"We should coordinate the development of our economy and defense capabilities, and combine efforts to make the country prosperous and military strong. We should further the great integration of military and civilian development, and work to achieve in-depth integration of the use of infrastructure and other key facilities based on demands and led by the government.\"33 According to the U.S. State Department, MCF is \"an aggressive, national strategy of the Chinese Communist Party\" whose goal \"is to enable the PRC to develop the most technologically advanced military in the world.\"34 This is to be accomplished via the \"elimination of barriers between China's civilian research and commercial sectors, and its military and defense industrial sectors.\"35 Though CMI and MCF are only concepts for operation between the Chinese state and the Chinese populace, government regulations and policy reflect the desired intent of both programs. Article 7 of the National Intelligence Law states, \"Any organization or citizen shall support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work in accordance with the law\" and \"the State protects individuals and organizations that support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence work.\"36 As a further measure to blur the lines between civilian and military operations, in 2016's National Defense Transportation Law, Chinese state authority was further expanded by placing \"obligations on Chinese transportation enterprises located abroad or engaged in international shipping\" to \"provide logistical support for PLA forces operating overseas\" as \"strategic support forces.\"37 These support forces are charged with \"rapid, long-distance, and large scale national defense support\" and are typically composed of \"large- and medium-sized Chinese companies.\"38 Finally, this law also \"China's 2017 strengthened construction standards for ships and aircraft to be built to military specifications,\" in keeping with the dual-use concept.39 The result is the possibility that civil ships could be easily repurposed for military use at a moment's notice. 3.6 Cause for U.S. Concern: The PRC's concept of using civilian commercial shipping to transport military supplies has been formally adopted via the formation of \"transport dadui.\"40 Literally translated, \"Dadui\" means \"military group.\" As mentioned earlier, and as an example, CMPort's indirect subsidiary, CSC RoRo Logistics Ltd. is the core of the \"Fifth Transport Dadui,\" and has participated in eight transport missions with the People's Liberation Army (PLA), as well as a civil-military exercise in 2017.41 The concept of transporting military units has been promulgated via various Chinese public forums, as seen in several images below identified as part of a U.S. Naval War College report: Image 3.2: Naval Ships and Merchant Magazine depiction of Roll-on-Roll-off vessels for vehicle transport.42  Image 3.3: 2017 Beijing Military exhibition of operations conducted with CSC RoRo Logistics Ltd. vessels.43  Such cooperation can also be seen in other forms of civil shipping. Sinotrans & CSC Co. Ltd, the subsidiary company of China Merchants Group, participated in underway replenishment (UNREP) activities with the Chinese Type 54A (Jiangkai II) frigate Linyi.44 The goal of this activity, according to the U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command is to enable ships to \"remain underway at sea indefinitely in support of our national interests\" by transferring \"items such as fuel, food, ammunition, repair or replacement parts, and personnel.\"45 This cooperation could allow extensive PLAN operations beyond traditional territorial ranges through the cooperative use of civilian supply assets. These instances of civil-military cooperation have become part of the basis for U.S. modeling of Chinese intentions. According to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission: \"China's basing model includes military facilities operated exclusively by the PLA as well as civilian ports operated or majority-owned by Chinese firms, which may become dual-use logistics facilities. Chinese firms partially own or operate nearly 100 ports globally, more than half of which involve a Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE).\"46 Based on this concept, the report also states: \"In the short term (next five years), the PLA will focus on consolidating the capabilities that would enable it to conduct large-scale military operations around its maritime periphery. In the medium term (next 10-15 years), the PLA aims to be capable of fighting a limited war overseas to protect its interests in countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). By mid-century, the PLA aims to be capable of rapidly deploying forces anywhere in the world.\"47 Following this same logic, and in accord with the previously stated Key Intelligence Question, this report has attempted to identify factors that threaten Critical Maritime Chokepoints within the scope of this question.. Relative to Chinese strategic imperatives of Food Security, Energy Security, and Trade Security, Chinese Belt and Road initiatives, specific to maritime expansion, have been identified and analyzed for their potential use as PRC dual-use stepping stones in a militarized environment, much like that described in the \"Thucydides Trap.\" 4. Analysis Factors 4.1 Intelligence Question Amplification: To reiterate, the Key Intelligence Question to be answered is: In the event of a Great Power Conflict, what Chinese maritime investments and developments abroad potentially threaten U.S. and Allied naval capability use of critical maritime chokepoints? After reviewing the strategic environment and the potential direction a Great Power Conflict (GPC) may take, the intricate relationship between Chinese Civil and Military ventures, and the extent of the BRI, this analysis investigates the potential for dual-use militarization of BRI infrastructure. With this specific direction in mind, the following additional intelligence questions have been created in order to fully answer and build upon the Key Intelligence Question: Where is China pursuing overseas maritime investment? To what extent are identified locations of Chinese investments being developed? What are the indicators associated with Chinese expansion plans and do they fall into a predictable timeline? What possible priorities do construction activities indicate? Has China deployed, or can it support the deployment of, threat weapons to these locations? What weapons could be supported at each location? What are the expected engagement envelopes of these weapons? How do these engagement envelopes affect maritime chokepoints? How would\/could they be transported? How do these threats affect maritime chokepoints? 4.2 Assumptions and Disclaimers: To completely answer these questions, a comprehensive analysis of the global situation would be ideal. However, the scope of this report is inherently limited based on manpower, resources, and time. For example, companies like CCCC have investments in over 80 countries, while commercially associated ventures like Terminal Link provide access to a multitude of global terminals for their parent companies. This analysis is further complicated by the sheer size of each company and the combined mass of international investments. Though possible to analyze each location, the time required and mass of information needed to accurately profile each individual point of interest would preclude the timely publication of this report. As such, several critical assumptions and concessions have been made that limit the conclusions of the report. First, this analysis focuses on a limited number, 17, of BRI locations of interest. Second, locations of interest have been selected based on their proximity to critical maritime chokepoints. Third, maritime strategic chokepoints have been limited to eight major waterways of global significance. As a consequence of these factors, and the underlying limitation of scope, the results of this report are a generalization of observed trends and cannot be definitely applied to the entire global spectrum of BRI activities. However, the conclusions made indicate the assessed possibility of certain actions and capabilities. Though there are doubtless many more locations of interest that are relevant to this discussion, and there are more maritime chokepoints of lesser significance, the selection of Chinese-built maritime facilities, whether completed or under construction, illustrates the concepts, themes, and application of GEOINT methods using limited resources to derive evidence-based analytic conclusions and possibilities. 4.3 The Importance of Maritime Chokepoints: While commercial factors are a significant component of any maritime chokepoint discussion, this report will focus on the potential restriction of movement imposed upon military maritime movements by potential PRC dual-use infrastructure. Academically, \"a chokepoint, in a strategic sense, should be a relatively narrow waterway, capable of being closed off to shipping.\"48 Consequently, this means there are \"no readily available alternative maritime route[s] to use in event of closure\" or \"an alternative waterway would be extremely costly.\"49 Additionally, a critical chokepoint must be \"of considerable significance to interests of several States, other than the State or States controlling the waterway.\"50 Alexander describes the military significance of chokepoints by tying them to the need for, \"the passage of military vessels and aircraft through narrow international waterways anywhere in the world.\"51 In the case of the United States, where for the last 30 years the preponderance of operations has focused on the Middle East, bringing logistical support and warfighting capability to bear has required the security of these chokepoints. In a Great Power Conflict, it is reasonable to assume that chokepoints will be of similar importance. 4.4 Identifying Critical Maritime Chokepoints: In his article, Alexander identifies seven \"primary chokepoints\": The Strait of Gibraltar, the Bab el Mandeb, the Strait of Hormuz, the Danish Straits, the Turkish Straits, the Suez Canal, and the Panama Canal.52 All these meet the three earlier criteria of being narrow, having no alternative route, and being significant to multiple nations. Additionally, Alexander lists eleven \"secondary chokepoints\" which include the Malacca-Singapore Strait and the Dover Strait, among others.53 For the purposes of this report, the Danish Straits will be omitted due to its limited role in a Great Power Conflict with China, though their significance in a similar conflict with Russia should not be discounted. Therefore, based on these lists, and for the purposes of the ensuing analysis, the following chokepoints are considered Critical Maritime Chokepoints (CMC) and have been grouped into one of four Areas of Responsibility (AOR): Southeast Asia, Middle East, Europe, and Americas: Table 4.1: Critical Maritime Chokepoints  To illustrate the significance of the chosen CMC, their locations have been superimposed on a National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration layer which compiled a generalized heat map of shipping traffic. Image 4.1: Representation of Maritime Traffic relative to selected Critical Maritime Chokepoints54  Visually, the selected maritime checkpoints intersect a significant portion of maritime shipping routes. Though there are alternatives that bypass the identified checkpoints, such as around the Cape of Good Hope, they incur significant costs to operations. 4.5 Locations of Interest: Based on the identified CMC, locations of interest (LOI) can be identified to answer the first intelligence question: Where is China pursuing overseas maritime investment? By using open source reporting from news agencies, social media outlets, and PRC proprietary media marketing, a preliminary investigation of BRI ventures in close proximity to the identified CMC has yielded 17 LOI. These 17 LOI have been similarly grouped into one of the four AOR. Table 4.2: Locations of Interest  4.6 Methods: Analysis of the LOI has been conducted using Maxar commercial imagery provided via the Google Earth platform. At each location of interest, subsequent analysis has searched for indicators of maritime expansion. Drawing from the earlier discussion of BRI, a notable indicator of Chinese infrastructure development is the presence of extensive land reclamation projects, as this is a key component of known expansion efforts in the South China Sea conducted by CCCC. Since land reclamation (if necessary) is a frequent first step in the typical port construction, it serves as a sound indicator for temporal analysis and building patterns of life. Where possible, an assessment of construction progress has been made to determine the expected progression of development. Additionally, an assessment of local room for potential expansion has been made where applicable. Specific emphasis has also been placed on identifying commercial and military shipping capabilities. Hosted vessels (military and commercial) will be identified to baseline the future capability to host threats enabled by those vessels. Based on the discussion of the PRC's civil-military relationship, the analysis has attempted to identify three specific types of operations capability: Military vessel, Roll-On Roll-Off (RO-RO) vessel, and Container vessel.\u00a0 This report will assess capability based on the observation of historical precedents for operations of certain types of vessels. This will be particularly important regarding Chinese military vessels. In an effort to derive more concrete conclusions, rather than induce speculation, assessment of naval vessel hosting capability will be established by 1) imagery confirmation of existing operations or 2) open source reporting of existing operations. In some cases, this may lead to assessments where smaller or less sophisticated facilities are deemed capable of hosting naval vessels while larger facilities are not. Moreover, such a deliberate methodology will provide a reliable assessment of current operations. Conversely, while a concrete assessment may not be possible at a larger facility due to the criteria above, the reader might infer the physical capability for naval hosting at a location capable of managing, for example, commercial supertankers. There are many variables that can induce limitations to which type of vessel a port can host, such as draft, fuel available, pilotage, etc. In an effort to limit scope, this report will not address niche aspects of port infrastructure as they pertain to vessel types, except where particularly relevant. Ream Naval Base provides an example of this precedent in discussing draft (5.1.1). Furthermore, while the premise of placing threat weapons on foreign territories is aggressive and confrontational, it can be accomplished with a degree of anonymity and done covertly. Doing so might not arouse concern or suspicion until after the fact. In contrast, the movement of military vessels is rarely covert. The movement of a military vessel into a foreign port, as in this hypothetical what-if scenario, would require some form of plausible explanation, pattern of life, or reasonable expectation of normalcy. That said, changing political environments and international relationships can rapidly change these assessments based on the willingness of other nations to cooperate with China, a variable that further reinforces the need for diplomatic engagement as part of the strategic environment.\u00a0 4.7 Open Source Threats: Disclaimer: All threat ranges are estimated via open source reporting and should not be considered authoritative, merely representative of threat potentials. To fully understand the implications of the Chinese capability to limit U.S. and Allied naval mobility via strategic chokepoints threats must be identified. To deny naval movement, which for the purposes of this report will only encompass surface vessels and their associated airborne assets, the PRC may utilize various anti-ship and anti-aircraft weaponry. Anti-Ship weapons will be limited to Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles (ASCM) and Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASBM). Anti-Aircraft weaponry will be limited to Surface-to-Air-Missiles (SAM). As this report seeks to identify only those threats which can rapidly be deployed to port facilities, threats will be limited to three general categories: mobile, naval, and containerized. This report defines mobile threats as wheeled or tracked vehicles capable of being transported by military or Roll-On Roll-Off vehicles. Naval threats are defined as combatant vessels with their associated weaponry. Finally, containerized threats are defined as concealable weapons within shipping containers. These specific weapon types are included because they may be overtly transported via military vessel or covertly transported via dual-purpose vessels that form the transport dadui mentioned earlier. Mobile threats include the DF-21D ASBM, YJ-18 ASCM, YJ-12 ASCM, SA-21, SA-10, and HQ-9. The DF-21D, YJ-18, and YJ-12 possess anti-ship capability with ranges of 800nm,55 290nm,56 and 270nm,57 respectively. For anti-aircraft systems, the SA-21,58 in its latest evolution, will be assessed with 250nm engagement zone, and SA-1059 will be modeled with a 120nm engagement zone. Naval threats are based on the weaponry standard on the Chinese Type 52D destroyer (Luyang III), the most sophisticated surface combatant noted, to date, at the PLA Expeditionary facility in Djibouti.60 The Type 54D is equipped with the HHQ-9 and HHQ-10 SAM, and the YJ-18 ASCM,61 with approximate ranges of 52nm, 9nm, and 290nm,62 respectively. Containerized threats include only the YJ-18C, which is a reported cruise missile variant capable of being operated from commercial shipping containers, with a range of 290nm.63 Though reporting is limited, reporting and rumors of both Russian and Chinese capability to field missile systems located in shipping containers should not be discounted. Russian systems of this type, based on the 3M54 family of cruise missiles, such as the Klub-K have been reported.64 Based on the history of Russian and Chinese arms cooperation, and the covert intent of these threats, being highly transportable and simultaneously very anonymous, the inclusion of such threats is based on potential intent and logical direction. 5. Analysis 5.1 Southeast Asia: 5.1.1 Ream Naval Base: Ream Naval Base is a Cambodian Military facility located in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. It is wholly-owned and operated by the Cambodian Government, with the nearby town of Sihanoukville the site of a deep-water port, currently under development in partnership with the Japanese government. Ream itself has been the site of recent controversy as speculation circulated that China had recently formalized a 30-year use agreement for the base,65 despite historic U.S. investment and involvement at the facility66 and denial of the agreement by the Cambodian government.67 Imagery analysis of Ream shows no specific Chinese activity or infrastructure investment. Though a naval facility, the placement of floating dry docks in the nearby channel, as well as the placement of a POL pier to the south, indicate the coastal waters are of insufficient depth for major surface vessels. As such it is assessed that Ream Naval Base will be incapable of hosting major shipping or warships pierside unless significant dredging and infrastructure modification is undertaken, and basing is limited to the observed coastal patrol craft. This does not preclude the use of deeper waters as a safe harbor for larger vessels, of which none have been observed to date. However, the shallow waters do significantly complicate the logistics of disembarking possible mobile threats. As such, the current assessment of Ream Naval Base is one of minimal hosting capability, with no observed capability for naval, mobile, or containerized threats. Subsequent monitoring should be conducted with emphasis on identifying indicators of potential PRC development and PLAN use. 5.1.2 Melaka Gateway Port Project: The Melaka Gateway Port Project began as a joint venture between the Malaysian government and a Chinese conglomerate comprising PowerChina International Group, Shenzhen Yantian Port Group, and Rizhao Port Group.68 Rizhao Port Group, notably, also operates Shandong province's Rizhao Port at which Landbridge Group maintains its corporate headquarters and operates multiple terminals.69 The project is of particular significance due to its location at the narrowest part of the Malacca-Singapore Strait which \"makes it an ideal choice for a deep seaport facility\" due to \"the strategic location [...] at the Straits of Malacca.\"70 Consequently, development of this location could significantly restrict any ability to transit the Strait. Initial land reclamation of the facility has been undertaken by the Malaysian KAJ Development however, imagery analysis of the effort corroborates reporting that KAJ has since lost the contract for development due to slow progress. This is indicated by the removal of construction support facilities, characterized by signature blue roofs, and dredging equipment. While the intricacies of the contractual arrangements for the facility can be generally characterized as unstable, the persistent presence of Chinese investors leaves reason for continued monitoring of the facility. Based on these factors, the current assessment of the Melaka Gateway Port Project is one of no hosting capabilities, with no observed capability for naval, mobile, or containerized threats. Subsequent monitoring should be conducted with emphasis on detecting the re-introduction of construction buildings, which will indicate renewed efforts at land reclamation and should prompt changes in collection requirements. 5.1.3 Port of Kuantan: The Port of Kuantan is a flagship BRI investment located on the eastern side of the Malaysian Peninsula. Kuantan is a joint venture between the Malaysian firm IJM and the Chinese Beibu Gulf Port Holding (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd, which maintains a 40% share.71 Beibu Gulf Port Holding (Hong Kong) acts as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Chinese SOE72 Guangxi Beibu Gulf International73 thus implying state interest in the port facilities. Imagery analysis of the port indicates completion of the planned phase 1A and 1B of modernization, which began in 2013 immediately following the launch of the BRI campaign and was approximately completed in January 2019. The continued presence of construction support facilities, noted by their blue roofs, and of unfinished land reclamation indicates construction is likely to continue. According to the Kuantan Port website, a second larger container terminal will be constructed, with undetermined \"future plans.\"74 Based on patterns of life from phase 1 construction, this phase will likely require three to four years to complete. The newly constructed unused pier infrastructure retains the capability to be used for vehicle off-loading based on pier construction. PLAN warship support has not been observed. Immediately to the south, the Malaysian Tanjung Gelang Naval Base indicates some limited capability for warship hosting, though this would require cooperation with the Malaysian government and may also serve as a limited deterrent to Chinese warship presence. Based on these factors, the current assessment of the Port Kuantan is one of moderate hosting capabilities, with no observed capability for naval threats but with the emerging capability to host mobile or containerized threats. Subsequent monitoring should be conducted with emphasis on monitoring phase two construction and maritime traffic at newly constructed port facilities. 5.1.4 Port of Singapore: The Port of Singapore is a strategically significant location for future Chinese investment based on its location at the junction of the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean via the Strait of Malacca. COSCO recently, in November of 2018, announced modification of its arrangement with PSA Co. Ltd. (formerly Port of Singapore Authority) which expanded COSCO port access from three wharfs to five. To reinforce the magnitude of the COSCO investment in Singapore, Mr. Ong Kim Pong, the Regional CEO for PSA International's Southeast Asia division75 stated, \"PSA is honored by the trust that CSP has placed in us to serve as their main hub port for container transshipment in Southeast Asia. With their continued support and confidence in PSA, we will strive to augment their strategic presence in Singapore.\"76 This reinforces the probability that Chinese investment in the Port of Singapore will continue to expand and is of strategic value. The port itself has the observed capability to conduct Roll-On Roll-Off and Container shipping operations. Based on these factors, the current assessment of the Port of Singapore is one of moderate hosting capabilities, with no observed capability for naval threats but with the capability to host mobile or containerized threats. Subsequent monitoring should be conducted with emphasis on monitoring COSCO shipping traffic and cargo manifests to establish a pattern of life. 5.1.5 Port of Kyaukphyu: The Port of Kyaukphyu, Myanmar, is a flagship port project as part of the Belt and Road Initiative, and more specifically the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor. The overt intent of this project is to facilitate Chinese Maritime economic interests through overland means terminating with the Port of Kyaukphyu as a means of dealing with the \"Malacca Dilemma.\"77 The \"Malacca Dilemma\" is the concept that the Strait of Malacca provides a limitation for Chinese economic activities to escape the South China Sea region if contested by another state.78 The acknowledgment of such a situation indicates the PRC's greater understanding of the significance of maritime chokepoints in the strategic sense. As such, the PRC has begun a process of development with the government of Myanmar via a Chinese SOE known as CITIC.79 As part of the development plans, Kyaukphyu is intended to operate a \"total of 10 berths, [...] constructed in 4 phases, with construction duration of 20 years,\" and \"the expected annual capacity of the DSP will be 7.8 million tons of bulk cargo and 4.9 million TEU containers.\"80 Currently, the only operations in the immediate vicinity are via a petroleum facility to the east of the proposed construction location. Based on these factors, the current assessment of the Port of Kyaukphyu is one of no hosting capabilities for naval, mobile, or containerized threats. However, based on imminent construction, monitoring should be conducted to assess construction progress and initial operating capability, which may then be used to trigger more robust collection efforts. 5.1.6 Port of Colombo: The Port of Colombo, located on the western coast of Sri Lanka, has seen extensive PRC-related activity. A subsidiary of CMPort, CITC, which conducts construction at Colombo as part of a BOT agreement, operates the newly built facility as a PPP.81 Nearby, CHEC is constructing the Colombo Port City as a complimentary BRI effort to serve as \"a catalyst for modern services in Sri Lanka.\"82 This indicates continued Chinese interest in the port for the foreseeable future. The east terminal, while operated by SLPA (Sri Lanka Port Authority) and not CITC, has hosted Roll-On Roll-Off vessels and a multitude of warships from several nations such as the U.S., Russia, and Japan. While not indicative of Chinese intent, it suggests the port is capable of hosting such vessels, if required or desired. To reinforce this capability, according to open source reporting,83 in 2014 several Chinese warships docked at Colombo. This event, coupled with a denied request for port visits in 2017,84 potentially indicates Chinese desire and capability to use the port to support military vessels. Based on these factors, the current assessment of the Port of Colombo is one of robust hosting capability of naval, mobile, and containerized threats. Subsequent collection should be conducted to monitor Chinese construction, which will continue for several years, and shipping activity, with identification of all military vessels entering the port. 5.1.7 Port of Hambantota: Also located on the island of Sri Lanka is the Port of Hambantota. Hambantota is currently owned and operated by CMPort, which controls 85% of port shares, as part of a 99-year lease agreement with the Sri Lankan government.85 As a major Chinese project predating BRI, Hambantota provides a template for project proceedings. Imagery indicates construction on the port began in 2010 and was completed in 2018, providing an approximate baseline for the timeline. The identification of buildings associated with construction and their relative erection\/demolition provides construction signatures that can be extended to other infrastructure projects. However, this timeline is limited by the temporal coverage of Google Earth imagery revisits, which preclude the ability to precisely determine start and stop dates, and only provide sufficient detail for approximation. Port operations include container operations and Roll-On Roll-Off vessels. While no naval vessels have been noted, as with Colombo, PLAN port visits and attempts to make port suggest PRC military interest in the country. Additionally, by referencing Image 3.1, from chapter 3, it is apparent that although Hambantota does not directly influence any CMCs, it lies along a major corridor between the Southeast Asia and Middle East regions, which makes it strategically relevant to the maritime environment. Based on these factors, the current assessment of the Port of Hambantota is possibly capable of hosting naval, mobile, and containerized threats. Subsequent collection should be conducted to monitor port operations, commercial shipping activity, and PLAN vessel activity. 5.2 Middle East: 5.2.1 Port of Khalifa: The Port of Khalifa, located in Abu Dhabi is the site of a COSCO-operated terminal, which was constructed between 2017 and 2018.86 The facility is part of a 35-year agreement to operate the terminal as part of China's BRI expansion.87 Imagery indicates the port facility is capable of container operations and Roll-On Roll-Off operations. Based on these factors, the current assessment is the Port of Khalifa has the capability to host mobile and containerized threats. Subsequent collection should be conducted to monitor port operations and commercial shipping activity to establish a pattern of life. 5.2.2 PLA Expeditionary Base: Perhaps the most significant overseas investment, though not wholly part of BRI, is the development of a PLA Expeditionary Base in Djibouti. Located roughly 10km from a U.S. military facility, the PRC has developed the base in close concert with its port expansions as part of BRI. Doraleh Multipurpose Port was constructed by CCCC and is currently operated by CMPort, which retains a 25-percent stake of ownership.88 Construction at the base began in 2014 and is still developing, with continued dredging operations ongoing in support of deep-water berthing, as well as various building construction projects. The base facilities indicate the ability to support aircraft, via the heliport tarmac, with hardened structures that could potentially be used for munitions storage. Via the use of Doraleh, which imagery shows had been used for PLAN berthing previously, the base could support significant quantities of troops and vehicles, with Roll-On Roll-Off capabilities also confirmed. The use of a PRC-controlled (via SOE) civilian port to support military vessels provides additional reinforcement to the concept of civil-military cooperation as part of China's BRI infrastructure development. Based on these factors, the current assessment of the PLA base in Djibouti is: significant hosting of naval, mobile, and containerized threats is possible and likely. Subsequent collection should be conducted to monitor unit deployments and identify specific threats. 5.2.3 Port of Sokhna: The Port of Sokhna is arguably one of the more benign and lower-profile investments of the BRI. The port itself is owned and operated by DP World, an Emirati shipping conglomerate based in Dubai. However, in 2018, DP World began construction on a second basin of Sokhna, which was contracted to CHEC.89 The project is nearing completion, with final infrastructure being put in place. Though this was initially only a construction agreement, DP World began a partnership with a COSCO and CSCEC (China State Construction Engineering Corporation) to utilize the newly constructed basin as the primary port for material deliveries destined for other inland BRI projects in the region.90 This has resulted in an expected expansion of PRC shipping operations at the yet unused second basin. Based on these factors, it is assessed that the Port of Sokhna will expand its operations and is capable of hosting containerized threats. Given the lack of operations, it is not possible to determine the extent of mobile or naval threat hosting at this time. Subsequent collection should be conducted to monitor shipping presence and operations details at the second basin location with the intent of developing greater fidelity of threat capabilities. 5.2.4 Port of Gwadar: The Port of Gwadar is a flagship BRI project. As a function of its location, it is a critical node of the CPEC and also a significant strategic outpost for maritime shipping transiting to\/from the Persian Gulf. The port itself is operated by COPHC, the CCCC subsidiary, and has been actively developed since 2013 as part of an extensive BRI plan. This includes the construction of several highways, secondary piers, industrial zones, and an international airport.91 Consequently, the location has seen significant development to date, both within and without the fence line of the existing port. Notably, the existing multipurpose port, despite being touted as a significant component of BRI, has experienced limited commercial activity to date. Equally notable, several Pakistani Naval vessels have been observed at the port, identified as Zulfiquar class frigates and Tariq class destroyers. The port's ability to host such vessels is significant because the Zulfiquar class is an export variant of the Chinese Type 53H3 (Jiangwei) frigates.92 This implies the ability to support Chinese warship requirements, both in draft and logistical requirements. Additionally, the Pakistani Navy has purchased further naval vessels from China: four Type 54A\/P frigates, a variant of the Jiangkai 2 class.93 As mentioned earlier, Chinese commercial ships have engaged in underway replenishment of Jiangkai 2 frigates. Thus, the port's ability to host Pakistani warships may indicate a willingness, or at least capability, to host Chinese warships of similar construction. Based on these factors, it is assessed that the Port of Gwadar will expand its operations and is capable of hosting naval, mobile, and containerized threats. Given the lack of operations, it is not possible to determine the extent of mobile or naval threat hosting at this time. Subsequent collection should be conducted to monitor operations, expansion efforts, and warship presence. 5.3 Europe: 5.3.1 El-Hamdania Port Project: El-Hamdania is a significant BRI investment, though at this time very little progress has been made. Construction began in late 2017\/early 2018 and to date has yielded very few results with the conclusion being the project has stalled as of 2019.94 The Memorandum of Understanding for the project entails construction requirements by CSCEC and CHEC with port operations to be retained by a yet undetermined Chinese firm for the first 25 years, post construction.95 It is expected Chinese companies will retain a 49% stake in the port.96 This is of particular significance because the militarization of El-Hamdania could pose a significant threat to the Strait of Gibraltar. While the agreement is commercial, the relationship between China and Algeria is one of increasing PRC leverage. Specifically, Algeria is the PRC's largest trading partner in Africa, with a very lopsided balance of trade.97 Additionally, the proportion of trade made up of Chinese weaponry is reported to be \"42% of exports to the continent.\"98 There have also been documented reports of Chinese naval vessels visiting the Algerian port of Algiers.99 Based on these factors, it is assessed that the El-Hamdania Port Project may expand its operations and will be eventually capable of hosting naval, mobile, and containerized threats. However, given the lack of development, it currently retains no threat hosting capability. Subsequent collection should be conducted to monitor construction and potential operations. 5.3.2 Port of Zeebrugge: The Port of Zeebrugge is strategically located on the mainland European side of the English Channel. Consequently, the purchase of roughly 76% of the former APM terminal, gives COSCO shipping a controlling interest at a major intersection of sea lanes.100 The rebranded CSP Zeebrugge Terminal \"is the first terminal in Northwest Europe in which the Company holds a controlling stake and will facilitate the Company in establishing its major hub ports and global strategic focal point.\"101 Based on imagery analysis, current operations at the terminal are strictly limited to container shipping. While the port does provide roll-on roll-off services, these serve mostly to carry traffic across the Channel via ferries. Roll-On Roll-Off car carriers are observed at the port but serve proprietary piers further inland and are thus not depicted. Of note, the CSP terminal is in close proximity to a Belgian Naval Base and thus could fulfill additional militarized requirements such as intelligence collection and non-kinetic application of effects, such as communications jamming. Based on these factors, it is assessed that the CSP Zeebrugge terminal is capable of only containerized threats. However, the proximity to a NATO facility may facilitate the use of the port for covert activities. Subsequent collection should be conducted to monitor operation. 5.3.3 Port of Piraeus: Piraeus Graphic 1  Piraeus Graphic 2  The Port of Piraeus is one of the more dramatic acquisitions the PRC has facilitated as part of BRI. While not an infrastructure project in and of itself, following the recession Greece encountered at the start of the 21st century, COSCO, via subsidiaries, has operated a container terminal since 2008.102 However, in 2016, COSCO acquired a controlling 51% share of the Piraeus Port Authority, which manages the entire port, with a follow-on condition that another 16% be transferred in 2021 subject to investment goals being met.103 Operationally, the port sees container and Roll-On Roll-Off operations regularly. Though the port is capable of hosting PLAN vessels, and has done so, the proximity to the Hellenic Naval Base at Salamis, approximately 3.5km to the east, makes the tactical feasibility of such hosting unlikely. However, much like Zeebrugge, this opens the door to facilitate non-kinetic and covert operations at Piraeus. Based on these factors, it is assessed that the Port of Piraeus is capable of hosting mobile and containerized threats, with naval threats unlikely. Subsequent collection should be conducted to monitor operations and cargo loading\/unloading. 5.3.4 Port of Valencia Similar to the Port of Piraeus, the Port of Valencia is controlled by COSCO. COSCO's purchase of the related port authority, Noatum Port Holdings, of which it owns a 51% stake, gave the shipping company control of the Port of Valencia and Port of Bilbao container terminals.104 Consequently, this gives COSCO control of \"the closest commercial port to the Suez-Gibraltar axis - the main route for interoceanic shipping lines.\"105 The Port of Valencia has hosted both container vessels and Roll-On Roll-Off vessels, though since the purchase by COSCO most RO-RO operations have ceased. Though some minor construction activities have been observed, it is unlikely significant construction will take place in the immediate future. Additionally, no naval vessels have been observed. Based on these factors, it is assessed that the Port of Valencia is capable of hosting mobile and containerized threats. Subsequent collection should be conducted to monitor operations, with emphasis on recognizing the resumption of RO-RO operations. 5.3.5 Port of Kumport: The Kumport Terminal, in Ambarli Turkey, is of particular significance to the Turkish Straits and holds a controlling position in the Sea of Marmara, at the southern mouth of the Bosphorus. While not as significant as other maritime chokepoints, this location enables complete control of shipping to and from many several European Countries. The port itself was purchased by a \"Tripartite Consortium\" comprised of CMPort, COSCO, and CIC Capital, which control 65% of Kumport via a 40\/40\/20 split.106 Of note, CIC Capital is a PRC SOE, as are COSCO and CMPort.107 Imagery indicates the port focuses primarily on container shipping, with a distinct lack of indicators typical of RO-RO operations. No military vessels are apparent at the facility, and given the restricted nature of the Dardanelles, the tactical risk involved in placing combatant vessels at Kumport is a significant factor. Based on these factors, it is assessed that the Port of Kumport is capable of hosting containerized threats only. Subsequent collections should be conducted to monitor operations to establish a pattern of life. 5.4 Americas: 5.4.1 Panama Colon Port Project: The Panama Colon Port Project is a joint venture acquired by Landbridge Group in 2016 and developed by Shanghai Gorgeous investment Development Group.108 The project is of particular significance due to its controlling location at the Caribbean entrance to the Panama Canal, visible in the image above yards from the acquired property. Such a location poses a credible threat to U.S. access to the Panama Canal, not only due to the hypothetical placement of weapons systems on a dual-use facility, but also via more simple means such as basic channel blockage from deliberately placed obstacles in the event of a conflict. Additionally, this location is significant because the activity observed here confirmed earlier imagery analysis that identified a construction signature. The established pattern, that construction support facilities can be typically identified via blue roof signatures, has been reinforced by open source collection from the company website at this facility that supports this identification.109 According to various project publications, Shanghai Gorgeous intends to develop an extensive container terminal, and imagery analysis indicates significant progress to that extent has been made. However, since January 2020 no construction progress has been made, and construction equipment (barges and cranes) have been removed, while construction support buildings have degraded significantly and rapidly. Such indicators suggest that construction has stalled for some reason. One possible explanation may be workforce difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, while another may be contractual or funding difficulties. Based on these factors, the current assessment of the Panama Colon Container Port is one of no hosting capabilities, with no observed capability for naval, mobile, or containerized threats. Subsequent monitoring should be conducted with emphasis on monitoring construction status, as indicated by maintenance on support facilities or the return of construction equipment.

Application of Analysis 6.1 Assessment of Key Intelligence Question: By applying the analysis of each port, as well as the assessment of threat capabilities listed above, and through the use of readily available GIS techniques, this report has created two assessments. First, a hypothetical worst-case projection of PRC threat capabilities for each BRI location has been developed to depict the potential threat each location poses to the U.S. and its allies if not properly managed through diplomatic, military, and economic channels. Second, an assessment of the current hosting capability of each location has been developed that matches current observed capabilities with the current threat estimate. In Southeast Asia, current port infrastructure supports the ability to disrupt shipping in the Indian Ocean, the approaches to the Strait of Malacca, the South China Sea, and even the Sunda Strait. While development is limited at Ream, Kyaukphyu, and Melaka, there is still redundant coverage of critical chokepoints. In the Middle East, current port infrastructure supports the ability to disrupt shipping in the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Eastern Mediterranean, and preclude transit via the Strait of Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb, Suez Canal, and Bosphorus. While development is limited at Sokhna and Kumport, even limited coverage poses a threat to such restricted waterways. In Europe, current port infrastructure supports the ability to disrupt shipping in the Dover Strait\/English Channel and the Strait of Gibraltar. Development is limited at Zeebrugge and non-existent at El-Hamdania, however, given the compressed nature of European sea routes, the single developed port of Valencia could affect the majority of the geographic region. In the Americas, the current port infrastructure does not support the ability to disrupt shipping. However, given the holdings in the region, as little as two to three years of development at the Panama Colon terminal could disrupt the most important maritime chokepoints in the western hemisphere. These graphics convey the current tactical significance Chinese covert prepositioning of threat weapons at dual-use facilities and assets would have on critical maritime chokepoints. It is currently assessed that the pre-placement of threat capabilities at the identified Belt and Road Initiative-related maritime infrastructures would enable the PRC to deny freedom of navigation to U.S and Allied maritime activities via all of the identified critical maritime chokepoints, with the exception of the Panama Canal. It is important to note, however, that this conclusion implies the possibility that China could use civilian facilities for military purposes based on observed capability. It does not suggest that China has, or indeed will capitalize on this position or opportunity. Though a capability might exist, there is a multitude of factors that may influence national ability and desire to exercise such capability. In this particular instance, exercising the capability to place offensive weapons on the sovereign soil of a European state, would trigger immediate diplomatic and military backlash if done without host nation cooperation. Indeed, such action could logically be seen as the opening acts of a global conflict. As such, though there may be the ability to place threat missiles, there may be no desire. Evaluation of Chinese national strategic intent, internally navigating all the sovereign territorial hypotheticals and permutations of weapons placement beyond economic port support, is beyond the scope of this report. Consequently, this report recognizes the limitations of the aforementioned conclusion. It applies only to a situation in which China might seek to actively conduct aggressive military actions with little regard for international opinion or ensuing conflict, which would imply the failure of multiple levels of geopolitical driving factors such as diplomacy, global economics, military alliances, and a changing of the global status quo. 7.

Specific cues for follow on collection and analysis can be obtained via open source monitoring of Chinese corporate and government press releases, as BRI fundamentally relies on a foundation of apparent relationship building and cooperation. Consequently, large movements in development will likely be forecast by public notification. When analyzing the use of ports moving forward, viewers should seek to initially update and monitor open source imagery on a periodic basis, with more detailed analysis prompted by unforeseen or extensive development between image sets. AIS monitoring might be considered to develop pattern of life for Chinese vessels, and ultimately, more advanced means of collection might be required to obtain specific insight into the nature of operations at each location.  Things To Watch Is China starting any new BRI projects? Has construction started\/restarted at Panama, Melacca, Kyaukphyu? What is the extent of Pro-Chinese sentiment in the countries discussed above? Is it increasing or decresing? What effect have recent U.S. policies had on strengthening\/weakening U.S. positions in the countries analyzed?

{"article":"The Ice Curtain_ Enhanced Defense of Russias Western Arctic.json","text":"Arctic  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors The Ice Curtain: Enhanced Defense of Russia's Western Arctic  In partnership with \n CSIS \n and written by \n Matthew Melino, \n Heather Conley, \n and Joseph Bermudez  Latest modern air defenses installed Impact improves Russian Arctic posture Published Dec 20 2019 3\u00a0years Go to map  Overview  Russia's military posture and the deployment of S-400s in its Western Arctic reflects the Soviet legacy of bastion defense comprised of \"concentric circles\" designed to protect strategic territory. Russia's priority is to defend its northwest coast and the surrounding maritime domain housing the Northern Fleet, Russia's most capable naval force. It also aims to reduce its strategic vulnerability in its Far North. S-400s and other assets are the groundwork for an established anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) network.  Activity GEOINT analysis confirms the deployment of the S-400 air defense system to Rogachevo Air Base on Novaya Zemlya archipelago from Russian public declarations. Press release vs. imagery validation methodology is simple yet effective when tracking progress or lack thereof.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  Background Rogachevo Air Base is located approximately 9 kilometers north-northeast of Belushya Guba (Belushya Bay) on the southern Yuzhny Island of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago. This air base routinely hosted long-range strategic bombers and fighter aircraft to intercept U.S. reconnaissance aircraft in the Arctic during the Cold War.1 Today, Rogachevo is commanded by the 45th Air Force and Air Defense Army of the Russian Northern Fleet which was formed in December 2015.2 Source: Google Earth Satellite imagery indicates that sometime between July 2014 and August 2015 a new air defense missile base was established west of the Rogachevo air base accompanied by a regiment-sized unit equipped with the S-300P (NATO reporting name: SA-10 Grumble) surface-to-air missile (SAM).3 Upgrades to air defense capabilities on Novaya Zemlya occurred during 2018-2019 and included the deployment of additional radar, electronic warfare, signals intelligence forces and related equipment in addition to the deployment of the S-400 (an upgrade from the S-300P) with the latter occurring during the July-August 2019 time frame. On September 16th the Russian Northern Fleet Press Service reported that the redeployment of forces and conversion to the S-400 system was complete.4 A few days later, on September 20th, the Press Service published a report on the ceremony celebrating the unit's achievement of operational status.5 Analysis The Importance of S-400s in the Arctic Russia's military posture in its Western Arctic reflects the Soviet legacy of bastion defense comprised of concentric circles designed to protect strategic territory.6 The S-400s provide more advanced radar and electronic warfare systems capabilities which expand the range of Novaya Zemlya's air defenses. The airspace monitored and controlled from Rogachevo Air Base has now increased to 600 kilometers for detection and 400 kilometers for engagement, according to Russian assessments,7 although western analysts estimate the range to be between 200-250km based on the system's current configuration.The S-400 reportedly reduces deployment time from stowed position to launch to 5 minutes8and complements previously implemented enhanced defensive measures including the establishment of two Arctic motorized brigades, an Arctic naval group and a command and control center at the refurbished Severomorsk-1 airbase. Russia's priority in the Arctic is to defend its northwest coast and the surrounding maritime domain around the Northern Fleet, Russia's most capable naval force which includes its only operational aircraft carrier, ballistic missile submarines, and surface combatants and submarines that are deployed worldwide. Russia's efforts to modernize its Arctic military posture includes refurbishing air bases and deploying advanced systems to defend and deny access to strategic bastions. The deployment of S-400 systems to Rogachevo Air Base enhances radar coverage around the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, plugging potential gaps between Nagurskoye Air Base on Alexandra Land and radar stations on the Kola Peninsula. As Russia seeks to increase the Northern Sea Route's economic viability, Russia perceives greater strategic vulnerability in its Far North.9 The S-400s and similar air defense systems deployed across the Russian Arctic (Alexandra Land, Kotelny, and Wrangel Island among others) address this vulnerability as the growing network of assets seeks to restrict freedom of action and lay the groundwork for effective anti-access\/area denial (A2\/AD) operations. The S-400s however pose a challenge to NATO in the region, potentially complicating aircraft freedom of operation in the Norwegian and Barents Seas, and potentially out to the North Atlantic. The system reinforces Russia's bastion defense and expands Russia's defensive capabilities potentially beyond the Barents Sea, while also complicating future efforts to reinforce regional allies during a time of crisis. On an operational level, the S-400 raises the potential costs for allies in the event of conflict, deterring them from deploying assets to the region. Russian Exercising of Its Bastion Defense Russia continues to demonstrate that its growing military capabilities in the Arctic can be deployed beyond the Kola Peninsula. In April, Russia issued a Notice to Airman (NOTAM) for the Norwegian Sea area along Norway's northern coast where Russian strike forces, including anti-submarine Tu-142s, long-range supersonic missile carrier-bombers Tu-22M3 aircraft, along with cruisers and submarines exercised bastion defense. It was reportedly the first time Russia has conducted such a complex exercise outside of the Kola Peninsula and Barents Sea, suggesting that Russia may be looking to expand its offensive operations and sea denial capabilities toward the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) Gap. Although incomplete, Russia's layering of air defense systems enhances deterrence against, and costs to the U.S. and NATO in the Arctic. Description Satellite imagery of the Rogachevo Air Base S-400 air defense missile base is located at 71.606747o N, 52.387603o E, approximately 3.2 kilometers west of the air base. It occupies an irregular shaped area that measures 700-meters-by-180-meters, encompasses approximately 104,600 square meters and is organized into a regiment-sized unit with: A headquarters and support area that appears to include the regimental headquarters, target acquisition battery, missile technical battery, transport company and maintenance company. Among the equipment visible are a number of 55K6E command post vehicles, a 91N6E Big Bird acquisition and battle management radar, a LEMZ 96L6-1\/96L6E acquisition radar, two 5P85SM\/SE2 self-propelled transporter erector-launchers (likely as spares or for training) and a number of support vehicles and trailers. Three firing battery areas. Each with four 5P85SM\/SE2 self-propelled transporter erector-launchers and a single 92N6E Grave Stone engagement radar all these are positioned on concrete pads10and a number of support vehicles. A 42-meter-by-60-meter missile reload storage revetment that contains at least 39 S-400 twin missile reload packs (some double-stacked).

{"article":"Part 2_ Ore Car Activity Up at Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex.json","text":"North Korea's Economy  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Part 2: Ore Car Activity Up at Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex  In partnership with \n CSIS \n and written by \n Joseph Bermudez  Latest Follow-up report on Wonsan Impact increased ore and passenger cars Published Nov 27 2018 4\u00a0years, 1\u00a0month Go to map  Overview  Update on North Korea's largest railroad rolling stock manufacturing and repair facility.  The continued dominance of ore cars at the complex is likely both a reflection of the nation's emphasis upon the extractive industries and the need to replace or refurbish heavily used rail cars.  Activity Trends in new imagery from July and October 2018.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  The Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex, located on the southern outskirts of the east coast port city of Wonsan, is the largest railroad rolling stock manufacturing and repair facility in North Korea. Commercial satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe collected on July and October 2018, as well as ground imagery released by North Korean media, indicates that the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex remains operational and is actively engaged in the manufacture of new ore cars, probable refurbishment or repair of additional ore cars, and the repair or production of general freight and passenger rail cars. When compared to satellite images from earlier in 2018, the images from July and October show continued shifting of railcars, changing sizes and composition of materials in open storage areas, and no significant construction or demolition of buildings within the complex. As with previous summer and fall imagery of the complex the extensive use of open spaces for gardening is apparent.1 The imagery from July 26 and October 30, 2018 shows that the total number of railcars observed at the complex remains in between the high and low numbers presented in our earlier report with approximately 74 visible in the July 26 images and 63 visible in the October 30 images. Ore cars dominate those observed at the complex with approximately 32 (43%) being present on July 26 and 25 (39%) visible on October 30.2 The remaining rail cars present consists of box cars, tank cars, flat cars, locomotives, and unknown (a category that is due to cars that are partially obscured by structures, in shadows, or where the resolution is insufficient to made a clear determination). The continued dominance of ore cars at the complex is likely both a reflection of the nations emphasis upon the extractive industries (e.g., coal) and the need to replace or refurbish heavily used rail cars that have received little or no routine maintenance. Ore cars can be seen in both images not only in the holding yards but dispersed around the complex near the paint shops, assembly halls, and shops. (See more images in Timeline section). The presence of over 200 logs floating in the log basin in the July 26 image and the absence of those logs in the October 30 image strongly suggests that there was a production or repair program involving freight and\/or passenger cars during July through October. These types of rail cars make extensive use of wood, while most other rail cars produced at the complex primarily use steel, iron, and aluminum. (See more images in Timeline section). This supposition may be supported by an image published in Nodong Sinmun on August 3, 2018 that shows passenger cars being manufactured at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex. Passenger cars being manufactured at the Wonsan Railway Rolling Stock Complex, Nodong Sinmun, August 3, 2018  References and Notes 1. Such gardening is typical of large industrial facilities in North Korea. 2. These numbers should be viewed as approximations as they only count the railcars present within the complex and engine servicing facility, not the adjacent Kalma Rail Station and holding yard. Additionally, the numbers do not account for the limited number of satellite images reviewed or seasonality.

{"article":"Part 1_ Investigating the Growth of Detention Facilities in Xinjiang Using Nighttime Lighting.json","text":"Human Rights  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Part 1: Investigating the Growth of Detention Facilities in Xinjiang Using Nighttime Lighting  In partnership with \n RAND \n and written by \n Eric Robinson \n and Sean Mann  Latest 380 detention facilities analyzed Impact nightlights data used to track human rights abuses Published Feb 26 2021 1\u00a0year, 10\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  A growing body of research has systematically documented Chinese efforts to imprison, detain, and re-educate ethnic Uyghur and minority groups throughout its western Xinjiang province. In this three-part investigation, RAND researchers explore new data on nighttime lighting in Xinjiang to offer new, empirical insights into China\u2019s efforts to reeducate, detain, and imprison its Uyghur and ethnic minority populations across Xinjiang.  This first report introduces our methodological approach and uses nighttime lighting data to investigate the rapid, coordinated growth of detention facilities in Xinjiang over the last decade. It captures the speed and scope with which China\u2019s detention campaign escalated beginning in 2016, an inflection point after which growth in Xinjiang\u2019s detention facilities would accelerate rapidly over the course of a multi-year campaign through early 2019.  Activity GEOINT analysis of nighttime lighting and satellite imagery data over known detention and reeducation facilities in Xinjiang reveals the explosive growth of these facilities over time, and reveals a coordinated campaign beginning in 2016 to construct the vast majority of Xinjiang\u2019s detention facilities over a multi-year period through mid-2019.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  A growing body of research has systematically documented Chinese efforts to detain, re-educate, and imprison its ethnic Uyghur and minority groups throughout western Xinjiang Province. Existing estimates suggest that between 1 million and 1.5 million Uyghurs and other minority groups may be detained in such facilities, subject to alleged reeducation and indoctrination, forced labor, false imprisonment, and even claims of physical and sexual abuse. As international pressure condemning these practices has grown in recent years, Chinese officials have variously denied the existence of these facilities, suggested that they serve only as benign vocational training centers, or that they are necessary to cure ideological diseases in those with problematic ideas sympathetic to radical causes. By mid-2019, the Chinese government began to suggest that the majority of such facilities, whatever their purpose, were no longer operational, either because vocational trainees had simply graduated and now settled into stable employment, or that released detainees have freed themselves from the influence of terrorism and religious extremism. Yet a steady flow of research and original reporting has since cast doubt on these claims, employing a mix of on-the-ground reporting from existing facilities, official documents, satellite imagery, and even nighttime lighting analysis to help identify new and growing facilities since 2019. To expand upon this research, this three-part series will use granular monthly data on nighttime lighting in Xinjiang to empirically assess the growth and decline of 380 known detention facilities across Xinjiang, as originally geolocated by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). The goal of RAND's research presented in this series is to provide an objective and systematic review of the status of Xinjiang's detention system, using a novel methodological approach. This report, the first in our series, introduces RAND's approach to measuring monthly trends in nighttime lighting over Xinjiang detention facilities, and discusses our efforts to empirically identify sustained periods of expansion and decline across these facilities over time. Then, using this methodology, it presents new analysis of the explosive growth of Xinjiang's detention facilities over the last decade, offering a novel and unvarnished look into China's coordinated efforts to construct an elaborate system of reeducation, detention, and imprisonment of its Uyghur and ethnic minority population in Xinjiang. Data on Known Detention Facilities in Xinjiang To assess the growth and decline in nighttime lighting over Xinjiang's detention facilities, we begin with data on the location of known facilities in Xinjiang collected in a seminal report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) published in late 2020. Using satellite imagery, nighttime lighting data, and primary and secondary sources, ASPI researchers geolocated 380 known or suspected facilities across Xinjiang, and assessed their level of security, overall purpose, the presence of factories for forced labor, and any visible evidence of construction, desecuritization, or potential decommissioning of these facilities over time. To get a sense of the geographic scope of this detention network, Figure One below maps the locations of all 380 detention facilities in Xinjiang from ASPI's dataset. ASPI categorizes each facility into one of four distinct tiers, based primarily upon its imagery signature and the level of security seen at each facility. ASPI's Tier One facilities are low security reeducation centers (108 in total), which are often connected to factories and may allow detainees to return to their own homes on the weekend. ASPI's Tier Two facilities are also reeducation centers (94 in total), but with higher security, and whose purpose is to rehabilitate detainees short of a prison environment.\u00a0 The final two tiers of facilities comprise the judicial component of Xinjiang\u2019s broader detention system. ASPI\u2019s Tier Three facilities (72 in total)\u00a0are characterized by secure housing facilities collocated with recreational facilities and administrative buildings on larger compounds. ASPI's initial research suggests these facilities are high-security detention facilities. However, based upon other sources of imagery analysis of Xinjiang\u2019s camps, and published Chinese construction regulations for prisons, we assess that these facilities are actually long-term prisons. ASPI\u2019s Tier Four facilities (107 in total) are characterized by fortified secure cell blocks with significant layers of security, largely without access to recreational or educational facilities seen in lower security facilities. While ASPI's initial research suggests that these facilities are maximum security prisons, we\u00a0 assess that these facilities instead serve as administrative or pre-trial detention centers. The lack of recreational, administrative, or factory facilities common to most of these locations is consistent with their role housing shorter-term detainees. Figure One. Location of Known Detention Facilities in Xinjiang Province Source: Data from Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020. Administrative boundaries from GADM.  RAND's Nighttime Lighting Methodology To assess the growth of these detention facilities over time, and assess their current operating status, this research leverages geospatial data on nighttime lighting in Xinjiang as a proxy for the level of activity at each facility over time. Overall, nighttime lighting data provide an equilibrium measure of electricity consumption at specific locations on the map, for a specific period in time. For detention facilities, changes over time in nighttime lighting may offer evidence of large-scale construction projects, new or expanded buildings, or alternatively, the closure of previously-occupied facilities. As such, we use monthly trends in nighttime lighting to help illuminate potential changes in the operating status of detention facilities. This approach allows us to capture changes in the intensity of activity at detention facilities that may not be visible in overhead satellite imagery, and at a minimum, helps us tip-and-cue our analysis to focus on facilities of interest. This approach follows that used in prior RAND research, where nighttime lighting data was used to assess changes in economic activity in cities captured by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. For this research, we calculate nighttime lighting estimates using monthly cloud-free composite raster images from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day\/Night Band, made available via the Earth Observation Group at the Colorado School of Mines. To assess nighttime lighting trends over each detention facility, we first reproject each composite nighttime lighting image from its original resolution (15 arc-seconds, or approximately 350 meters at 40-degrees latitude) to a finer-scale 30-meter resolution using simple linear interpolation. This improves our ability to accurately measure nighttime lighting for smaller facilities and helps to reduce potential bias from adjacent infrastructure. From these images, we then calculate the average nighttime lighting inside 200-meter, 500-meter, and 1-kilometer radius buffers around the center of each facility. Then, we use an automated algorithm to select the most appropriate buffer size for each facility, based upon its overall size and its proximity to nearby industrial facilities, urban areas, and other detention facilities. This approach helps further minimize, although not eliminate, potential bias from the nighttime lighting of adjacent infrastructure with potentially different trends in nighttime lighting. The resulting monthly trendlines for each detention facility therefore represent the average raw nighttime lighting value from the NOAA VIIRS sensor over each facility. But because raw VIIRS values themselves prove relatively noisy over time, we take two additional steps to produce representative trendlines capable of providing useful insights into the level of activity at individual detention facilities. First, we normalize all nighttime lighting measurements for each facility to its value in January 2018, improving our ability to make meaningful comparisons of the relative growth of facilities over time across facilities. Second, we smooth these normalized estimates using a ten month double moving average that allows us to identify sustained, uninterrupted periods of growth and decline in the signature of each facility, punctuated by clear inflection points. Of note, we define uninterrupted periods of growth or decline as any six month period where the smoothed nighttime lighting estimate consistently rises or falls. To show this approach in action, Figure Two below offers satellite imagery and nighttime lighting data from an example reeducation center in Xinjiang's southern Hotan Prefecture. In the top panel of this figure, overhead imagery from November 2019 shows the 200-meter buffer used to calculate average nighttime lighting for this center, used to minimize potential bias of adjacent nighttime lighting from nearby industrial facilities and residential areas in close proximity. Figure Two. Example Nighttime Lighting Trajectory of a Detention Facility in Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang Note: The overhead satellite image was captured on November 25, 2019. Nighttime lighting estimates are shown for each month from January 2014 through May 2020, plotting both normalized (in blue) and ten month double moving average (in red) nighttime lighting estimates. Growth periods are shaded in gray, and decline periods are shaded in yellow. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020. Imagery via Google Earth, 2019.  In the bottom panel of Figure Two, the average monthly nighttime lighting of this facility is shown for each month from January 2014 through May 2020 (the last month in which data is available), shown in blue. These values are normalized to the level of nighttime lighting seen over this facility in January 2018, in order to better assess relative changes over time. This approach allows us to easily assess the magnitude of changes in nighttime lighting over time at this facility. For example, nighttime lighting over this reeducation center in January 2016 was roughly 80 percent lower than in January 2018. The ten month moving average of this normalized nighttime lighting estimates are then shown in red, working to flatten out the somewhat noisy monthly variations in nighttime lighting and help isolate clear trends in the growth and decline of this facility. As shaded in gray, we assess that this reeducation center experienced a major period of steady growth beginning in September 2015 and ending in November 2018. This was followed by a sustained period of decline in nighttime lighting through the end of our\u00a0dataset in May 2020, as shaded in yellow. Correlating Nighttime Lighting Growth with Construction Activity To contextualize the real-world implications of changes in nighttime lighting, we can use overhead satellite imagery to correlate these changes with visible indicators at known detention facilities in Xinjiang. In this report, we focus specifically on growth across the Xinjiang detention system; our second report will focus on decline. More broadly, we see two major types of growth at the facilities in our dataset. In some cases, major growth in nighttime lighting at the location of a known detention facility occurs when that facility is built from scratch on formerly vacant land, often in rural areas with minimal existing infrastructure. In these cases, spikes in nighttime lighting at a specific location represent new electricity consumption where little to no nighttime lighting previously existed. Figure Three below provides overhead satellite imagery and nighttime lighting data for such a facility in Turpan Prefecture, in northeastern Xinjiang. It shows a high security reeducation center under construction in 2018 in a formerly empty rural area, with building underway in the southeast corner of the property, a large volume of cars visible in a parking lot in the northeast corner, and construction storage visible in the northwest corner. Construction as shown by the nighttime lighting data in this figure grew rapidly in early 2017, and approached completion in early 2018. The growth period flagged by our double moving average (shaded in gray) leads these dates by a few months, while the decline period flagged by our algorithm (shaded in yellow) captures the point at which construction of this facility began to slow in pace. Figure Three. Detention Facility Construction in Rural Area of Turpan Prefecture, Xinjiang Note: The first image was captured on October 20, 2013. The second image was captured on March 23, 2018. Nighttime lighting estimates are shown for each month from January 2014 through May 2020, plotting both normalized (in blue) and ten month double moving average (in red) nighttime lighting estimates. Growth periods are shaded in gray, and decline periods are shaded in yellow. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020. Imagery via Google Earth, 2013 and 2018.  In other cases, spikes in nighttime lighting offer evidence of major construction at preexisting schools, prisons, or other facilities that are repurposed to serve a different role, or simply expanded to handle a larger volume of detainees. Figure Four below provides overhead satellite imagery and nighttime lighting data for such a facility in Ili Prefecture, in northwestern Xinjiang. A low-security reeducation center appears to have been constructed in place of an existing school in a built-up urban area. Major construction of a new building within the center of the facility is seen in satellite imagery from September 2018, at roughly the same time as a major spike in nighttime lighting. In this case, our nighttime lighting analysis flags the start of growth at this facility in early 2017, based upon an inflection point in the smoothed moving average. This roughly correlates with the incidence of major construction at this facility seen in satellite imagery, although we lack access to imagery from the exact start of this growth period. Similarly, overhead imagery shows few signs of construction following the start of the decline period flagged by our algorithm, beginning in early 2019. Figure Four. Detention Facility Construction at Existing Facility in Ili Prefecture, Xinjiang Note: The first image was captured on April 18, 2014. The second image was captured on September 3, 2018. Nighttime lighting estimates are shown for each month from January 2014 through May 2020, plotting both normalized (in blue) and ten month double moving average (in red) nighttime lighting estimates. Growth periods are shaded in gray, and decline periods are shaded in yellow. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020. Imagery via GoogleEarth, 2014 and 2018.  Overall then, we assess that major spikes in nighttime lighting represent evidence of construction at known detention facilities. In some cases, this growth represents construction of new facilities from scratch, or even new buildings on facilities as they expand over time. In other cases, it represents construction activity to repurpose existing facilities to serve as detention camps. Either way, nighttime lighting serves as a useful metric to capture both the timeliness and magnitude of growth in Xinjiang's broader detention system. Measuring the Overall Growth of Detention Facilities After analyzing the nighttime lighting trends of all 380 detention facilities in our dataset, we can ultimately assess the extent to which major periods of construction occurred across the broader Xinjiang detention system. Figure\u00a0Five below plots the number of detention facilities in our dataset experiencing a major period of growth in nighttime lighting for each month since January 2014. We include those facilities experiencing a major decline as well, for reference. In a given month on this figure, each bar represents the number of distinct detention facilities experiencing an uninterrupted period of growth (blue) or decline (red) in smoothed nighttime lighting. Figure Five. Detention Facilities Experiencing Major Growth or Decline in Nighttime Lighting, 2014-2020 Note: Each bar represents the number of facilities, in a given month, experiencing an uninterrupted period of growth (blue) or decline (red) in smoothed nighttime lighting for at least six months. Negative values represent the number of facilities with declining nighttime lighting. Estimates are reported from January 2014 to May 2020. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  This provides a clear, visual representation of the massive growth in Xinjiang's Uyghur and ethnic minority detention system over time. Importantly, it reveals a clear inflection point beginning in 2016, when the construction of detention facilities across Xinjiang ballooned at a rapid pace. Throughout 2016, an average of 15 new facilities per month entered into new, sustained stretches of growth in nighttime lighting. By 2017, construction across Xinjiang would reach its overall peak, with an average of 264 detention facilities per month in the midst of sustained growth in nighttime lighting. This rapid pace of construction and expansion would decline only slightly in 2018, with an average of 240 facilities per month in the midst of sustained nighttime lighting growth. Elevated levels of construction in Xinjiang would continue in earnest through early 2019, at which point the number of detention facilities beginning new periods of growth in nighttime lighting falls considerably. This does not suggest, however, that construction of detention facilities came to a halt in early 2019. Rather, this analysis highlights that construction continued within nearly 80 facilities per month through at least mid-2020, the endpoint of our analysis. This finding comports with existing evidence based upon satellite imagery, as compiled in ASPI's original investigative work, to suggest that at least 61 detention facilities have been constructed or expanded between July 2019 and July 2020. It also remains possible that new facilities have been constructed elsewhere in Xinjiang not captured in ASPI's dataset of 380 facilities used in this analysis. Either way, our analysis suggests that construction of Xinjiang's broader detention system was primarily concentrated over a roughly 36-month campaign, beginning in 2016 and lasting through early 2019. Over this time period, 69 percent of detention facilities in our dataset began major growth periods in nighttime lighting, lasting an average of 27 months, and ending their growth periods with 370 percent higher nighttime lighting levels on average. More importantly, the stark inflection points marking the beginning and end of this expansion period imply deliberate efforts to ramp up the pace of reeducation, detention, and imprisonment of Xinjiang's Uyghur and ethnic minority population over this time period, in line with existing research.

Looking Ahead This report, the first in a series of three, introduced RAND\u2019s methodological approach to analyzing nighttime lighting, and offered new evidence to quantify China\u2019s efforts to rapidly expand its detention efforts across Xinjiang beginning in 2016. Our next report will use nighttime lighting data to assess the current operating status of all 380 facilities in ASPI\u2019s dataset and seek to validate official Chinese government claims to suggest that many of these facilities are no longer operational.  Things To Watch Have additional detention facilities been constructed in the last two years, beyond those analyzed in this research? Will growth in nighttime lighting continue at the nearly 80 detention facilities each month still experiencing growth since 2019? Can other forms of geospatial data be used to validate these results?

{"article":"Infrastructure Developments for Training Chinas Army.json","text":"China's Military  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Infrastructure Developments for Training China's Army  In partnership with \n West Point \n and written by \n Jacob Suppiah, \n Ashley Dolan, \n Garrett Smoot, \n and Ainsley Burrell  Latest Significant Infrastructure Development at Zhurihe Impact Improved Ability to Conduct Realistic Training Published Apr 8 2022 9\u00a0months, 1\u00a0week Go to map  Overview  The Zhurihe training base, China's most premiere training site, has undergone significant infrastructure developments since the mid-to-late 2010s. Such developments include the expansion of rail depots, logistics areas, urban training areas, and construction of an energy farm. These developments and the extensive maneuver space suggest an improved ability to conduct and support realistic training exercises. The 195th Mechanized Infantry Brigade is the permanent blue force at Zhurihe. Precedent and available information suggest that approximately 10 brigades total, spanning across China's five theater commands, could cycle through the base each year. Activity The infrastructure developments at the Zhurihe training center took place in five distinct areas. Over the course of a 16-month time frame, from March 9, 2020 to November 1, 2021, an energy farm was built to the north of the main base, housing for the blue force increased, a rail depot expanded significantly, an urban training center more than doubled in size, and a mock runway to the south of the training area increased in size. These observed infrastructure changes reflect the PLA's commitment to expand the size and sophistication of its premiere joint training base. Article  Timeline  China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has increased its focus on joint operations since the mid-2010s. There is sufficient literature stating the PLA's desired shift to joint operations, but assessments of successful implementation are in shorter supply. This study is intended to shed light on this topic by analyzing the growth of PLA Army (PLAA) capabilities at the Zhurihe joint training center. The development of warfighting infrastructure from March 2020 to November 2021 highlights that PLAA capacity to conduct realistic training has increased. The last major imagery-based report on Zhurihe analyzed construction activity up to April 2020. Our analysis shows increased and continued construction well toward the end of November 2021. The fact that the PLA has shifted focus to joint operations is relatively clear from literature reviews, but evidence of this shift in practice is more scarce. The U.S.'s Infantry Magazine reports that over the last decade the PLAA has started transitioning its main fighting force into high-mobility (HIMOB) combined-arms (CA) battalions. This new construct, which is intended to replace older, heavy-mechanized units, can enable more streamlined tactical and operational decisions on the battlefield for PLAA forces. However, the PLAA lacks combat experience despite its force modernization. Since its modernization process began in the early 2010s, the PLAA has not tested its new capabilities in armed conflict. Thus, training evaluations serve as a proxy to measure impact. Infrastructure Developments at Zhurihe: The PLA has increased emphasis on joint operational training centers hosting realistic exercises. The Zhurihe base, located in Inner Mongolia, is China's primary joint training center. A permanent opposing force (OPFOR), or \u201cblue force,\u201d is stationed at Zhurihe. Other PLAA units cycle through the base, serving as the \u201cred force\u201d that attempts to defeat the permanently stationed blue force. The ability to sustain increased red force elements at the training center indicates that the PLAA is able to hone its skills when it comes to the new HIMOB CA concept. This concept is centered on the idea that HIMOB CA battalions are light and have streamlined command and control. Having an increased number of red force soldiers at the base during each training cycle helps the PLAA refine its command and control of these units. Figure 2. Image of the Zhurihe base from November 2021. A general scan of this images compared to the one above shows significant expansion since March 2020. (Copyright Maxar 2021)  Figure 3. This side-by-side of the respective images from March 2020 and November 2021 shows key areas of change highlighted in yellow boxes.  Figure 4. Solar and wind farms were added to the base between March 2020 and November 2021.  Figure 5. An ammo depot was expanded between March 2020 and November 2021.  Figure 6. Buildings for blue force housing were added, suggesting that more blue forces and red forces could be cycled through the base for training. On the top of the image, there are six new barracks-like buildings. As of 01 November 2021, these structures were still under construction. In the bottom right of this image, there are three new barracks-like buildings, petroleum, oil, and lubricant tanks, and several other structures. These developments show the PLA's commitment to expanding the operating capacity of Zhurihe.  Figure 7. Expansion of a railway system took place in the examined timeframe. The expansion of the rail system into Zhurihe is vital to bringing units in for training. The railway enables the ability to both bring in and deploy units rapidly.  Figure 8. The urban training area at Zhurihe was refined and developed in the examined timeframe. This is evidence of the PLAA's desire to train HIMOB CA battalions for urban operations.  Conclusions: An estimate of the PLA's joint operational capability through this training center impact study sheds light on the likelihood of China's success in a military conflict. Existing open-source literature makes it clear that the PLA has been modernizing its fighting style and structure since the mid-2010s. That modernization is centered around the concept of the HIMOB CA battalion, which uses streamlined communications capabilities and light-to-medium fighting vehicles. In this study, efforts were made to estimate the progress of PLAA modernization using imagery analysis of the PLA's largest joint training center. Imagery analysis of the base from March 2020 to November 2021 shows several infrastructure developments which make clear that the permanently resident blue force is increasing its operational capacity, which implies that the rotating red forces are increasing their capabilities, as well. The type of infrastructure added to the base helps to achieve the more modernized, streamlined fighting style the PLAA seeks to employ through its HIMOB CA battalion concept. This is an important takeaway for U.S. military commanders. In the case of the PLAA, imagery analysis supplements literature reviews that report the continual refinement of Chinese joint forces at training centers like Zhurihe.

{"article":"Made in China 2025 and the Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park.json","text":"China's Economy  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Made in China 2025 and the Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park  In partnership with \n College of William & Mary \n and written by \n Zoe Roberts, \n Garrison Goetsch, \n Kaitlyn Wilson, \n Remington Fritz, \n and Charlie Altman  Latest Increased construction throughout park Impact Development concentrated in the computer industry Published Jun 15 2022 6\u00a0months, 4\u00a0weeks Go to map  Overview  The policy goals of the Made in China 2025 (MIC25) plan have increased development in Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park's dominant industries. From 2015 to 2022, imagery analysis showed increased activity and construction, much of which promoted MIC25's core industries. The majority of this development occurred in the communications, computer hardware, and wireless technology sectors, with some development in biomedical technology. Our findings suggest that Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial park is successfully promoting pre-existing advanced industries, but not new industries. Activity This Tearline article from William & Mary's geoLab is one in a series of three reports analyzing China's Made in China 2025 (MIC25) policy's impacts on Chinese industrial parks. This report examines the Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park using radar imagery, electro-optical imagery, and text-based data. In addition to the MIC25-connection thesis, this report serves as a baseline on the history, composition, and expansion of the zone. Article  Timeline  Figure 1: The MIC25 Policy focuses on ten industries: advanced information technology, automated machine tools and robotics, aerospace and aeronautical equipment, ocean engineering equipment and high-tech shipping, modern rail transport equipment, energy-saving and new energy vehicles, power equipment, resource extraction, medicine and medical devices, and agricultural equipment. Source: MERICS.  The Chinese government created Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park in 1997 and has continued to develop it under the MIC25 policy. Special policies have been implemented in the industrial park with the intention of promoting investment and development in the key industries outlined by the MIC25 policy. This report aims to determine the extent to which MIC25 successfully promoted high-tech industries in Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park. Our previous report examined an industrial park in Beijing, and a simultaneous report examines one in Shanghai. These case studies can be used as bellwethers for the overall success of the MIC25 policy. Using satellite imagery from 2015 to the present alongside mapping data and press reporting, we determined what physical construction has occurred and what types of companies have appeared in Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park. We find that, since 2015, significant expansion has taken place in the park's communications, computer hardware, and wireless technology sectors, with some expansion occurring in the biomedical sector. Methodology Our team, based out of the geoLab at William & Mary, used satellite imagery and publicly available web pages to determine how MIC25 has affected Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park. Public web sources such as Chinese government material for policy information, online company profiles of businesses in the park, mapping services, and press reporting were used to determine the park's intended function and details on government policies. Information from these sources supplemented our analysis of trends and physical developments by providing details that were not visible from overhead imagery analysis. This information also helped inform the analysis we conducted using geographic information systems (GIS). Figure 2: Sample of the SAR script running inside Google Earth Engine.  Overview: The Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park In the city of Shenzhen, a total of 147.96 km2 are dedicated to promoting innovation and advanced industries. Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park, a 11.52km2 park founded in 1997, is one of many industrial parks in Shenzhen envisioned as primary sub-areas for the promotion of new industries. It is bounded by the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Expressway in the north, Binhai Avenue in the south, Qilin Road and Nanyou Avenue in the west, and Shahe West Road in the east. The industrial park is divided into three districts by Beihuan and Shennan Avenue north, central, and south. Figure 3: Map showing the areas where we analyzed satellite imagery as well as completed company profiles. Original work, made using publicly available information.  Development of Targeted Industries Open radar imagery from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite analyzed in Google Earth Engine allows us to track change over time, and when combined with on-the-ground reporting, determine what type of activity is occurring. Development will be measured by looking at the types of industries experiencing growth. Based on information from Baidu Maps, the majority of the park's companies seem to be operating in high-tech industries. We focus on these high-tech companies and disregard service industry (e.g. restaurants and hotels) and non-high-tech companies since most of them seem to be complementary to the high-tech companies, providing services for workers and residents. Figure 4: An overview of the Google Earth Engine Sentinel-1 data of the park from 2015 to 2021. As shown in Figure 4, substantial activity occurred throughout the park over this time period. While the intensity of this activity seems to indicate construction and development, some of the detected backscatter may result from moving vehicles or other routine activities. By supplementing SAR data with other open source information, we can determine which activities are causing these patterns. Figure 7: Sentinel-1 image showing the activity in the park from throughout 2021, which has decreased since construction's 2017 peak. Through this time series, we can see that MIC25 has stimulated activity within the park, with only minimal activity in 2015 when MIC25's was first introduced and most activity occurring a few years later after MIC25's launch. This pattern is consistent with what we would expect to see given that MIC25 is a ten-year industrial development policy; the initial stage of development is marked by rapid activity in the form of construction which is followed by a second stage of development focused on attracting and fostering new companies. Kexing Science Park Figure 11: A table showing the sectors of the companies we located in Kexing Science and Technology Park with a pie chart showing the division of these companies among the MIC25-defined core industries. Companies operating in multiple industries were double counted for total quantity, once for each industry, and half-counted for each industry in the pie chart. Original work. Based on this distribution of industries, Kexing Science and Technology Park demonstrates that MIC25 has increased the development of the core industries in Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park, but that this development is largely concentrated in computer-related industries. Shenzhenwan Science and Technology Ecological Garden Figure 15: A table showing the sectors of the MIC25 industry companies we are aware of within Shenzhenwan Science & Technology Ecological Garden with a pie chart showing how these companies break down between different MIC25-defined industries. Companies operating in multiple industries were double counted for total quantity, once for each industry, and half-counted for each industry in the pie chart. Original work.  Visible Trends In both Kexing Science and Technology Park and Shenzhenwan Science and Technology Ecological Garden, the vast majority of development is occurring in computer-related industries. In these areas, 85% and 80%, respectively, of identified companies operate in computer-related sectors. We hypothesize that this concentration of MIC25-driven development in computer-related industries results from Shenzhen's pre-existing specialization in these fields. Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park has been the target of efforts to develop the computer and communications industries since well before MIC25's implementation. Since the mid-2000s, the park's targeted areas of development have been electronic information, bioengineering, new materials, and opto-mechatronics. In 2015 (the year MIC25 was introduced, before it could have a large impact) communications equipment, computer manufacturing, electrical machinery, and equipment manufacturing were already Shenzhen's three largest industries. The park has long been recognized as having a strong foundation for communications development. The city of Shenzhen dominates China's computer industry and Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park makes up a large part of that manufacturing. For example, in 2010, the park produced 40% of Shenzhen's computers. The presence of large firms like Huawei, Tencent, and ZTE make Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park especially poised to develop its communications, next-generation IT, and computer industries. Huawei and ZTE are both major players in the 5G field and produce consumer devices like smartphones. Tencent offers cloud computing services and maintains QQ and WeChat, two of the most prevalent Chinese social media and messaging services. Given this long-established focus on computer-related industries, it is easier to continue development in these already-dominant industries, rather than introducing new areas of specialization. This trend of development occurring only in pre-existing industries holds true outside of computer-related industries as well. While most development has been computer-related, those non-computer companies which have popped up since 2017 have been concentrated in the biomedical and new materials industries, which were original priorities for the park alongside electronic information ( computers, communications, and microchips). Out of the ten non-computer-related companies found in these two parks, seven have been in the biomedical or new materials sectors. Of the remaining three companies, two have been in the energy equipment sector and one has been in the energy-saving vehicles industry - perhaps suggesting that the environmental aspect of MIC25 is having a positive, though small impact. We conclude that MIC25 has spurred growth in Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park, but primarily in the advanced industries in which the park already had a comparative advantage. The greatest development occurred in the communications, computer, and next-generation IT (primarily 5G) sectors, which already dominated Shenzhen. Some growth has also occurred in the bioengineering and biomedical sectors, which the park has been fostering for over a decade. Energy-saving vehicles or new energy development has been minimal suggesting that the environmentally-focused aspect of MIC25 has had a small yet positive impact on development.. Shenzhen University Figure 16: Map showing the area and outline (light blue and black outline) of Shenzhen University. Original map made from Open Street Map base. Historically, Shenzhen University has provided tangible benefits in business and innovation in advanced industries. One such example is Tencent Holdings Ltd., a major Chinese conglomerate, which was founded by a university alumnus. Its subsidiary, Tencent Music, is present in Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park. It continues to provide for the park, as the 40,000 students who attend the university comprise a vast pool of human capital available for the park. The university is actively building and expanding programs that will assist in the development of MIC25 core industries, as in 2020 it added Financial Technology and Robotic Engineering majors. Shenzhen University also conducts relevant policy research on MIC25 and the Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park. The university is home to the China Center for Special Economic Zone Research, the only one of China's key research bases which focuses on special economic zones. Thus, Shenzhen University may impact Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park and MIC25 itself by influencing policies through its research, though the extent of this impact is unknown. Figure 18: Electro-optical satellite imagery detailing the construction of a dorm on Shenzhen University's campus from 2017 through completion in 2019.  Green Infrastructure and Spaces Many of MIC25's ten core industries focus on clean energy and energy-efficient technologies. Additionally, MIC25 includes goals of decreasing energy and water consumption by 35% in companies' research and development processes, developing green factories and industrial parks, and increasing thermopower, hydropower, and nuclear power facilities. As part of the core industry of energy saving and new energy vehicles, China produced 53% of the global market share of electric vehicle (EV) batteries in 2017. Within Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park, Shenzhen VMAX New Energy contributes to this industry by providing electric vehicle batteries, wireless electric vehicle charging equipment, and other energy-efficient products for car companies while Qingdao Jia'en Semiconductor company designs and produces semiconductors for electric vehicles. Additionally, Shenzhen Fast Technologies, which operates out of the industrial park, produces 20 million solar products per year, contributing to MIC25's goal of energy efficiency. As evidenced by the emergence of these companies, the industries within the industrial park seem to be contributing to MIC25's broader goal of increasing energy efficiency and decreasing China's environmental footprint. In addition to MIC25's goals, Shenzhen's 13th Five-Year Plan laid out three related goals: to reduce carbon emissions, to maintain air quality, and to continue economic prosperity. Shenzhen has since implemented many green policies including closure of resource-intensive factories, revitalization of unused spaces, and addition of low-emissions electric buses and taxis. Other approaches taken in Shenzhen include carbon trading, \u201cgreening\u201d construction regulations and increased environmental transparency and accountability.

Walking paths indicate that these green roofs are intended for human use.  Quality of Life in Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park and the Surrounding Area Figure 22: annotated electro-optical satellite imagery detailing several residential plazas under construction since 2015. In addition to attracting young, middle-class, highly educated workers, these residential changes force current residents and factory workers out of their homes. Developers are looking to Shenzhen's \u201curban villages\u201d as targets of redevelopment and modernization, forcing current residents to move out with as little as one month's notice. Additionally, as of 2018, the average rent increased from $100 to $250 per month, a particularly difficult price to pay for factory workers who made an average of $600 per month. China's effort to construct subsidized housing is moving slowly, leading to a housing affordability crisis. Many workers are being pushed outside of Shenzhen, and some are leaving Shenzhen completely and returning home. Figure 25: a translation of a CCP commissioned video celebrating Chinese work culture - though there may actually be dissatisfaction among workers about work expectations for them. Translation: \u201cBecause you're not willing to leave work, the subway pulls overtime with you.\u201d In 2010, Foxconn's Shenzhen facility reported 18 suicide attempts, 14 of which were successful. As the suicides gained international media attention, Foxconn employees revealed details of their working conditions including extreme levels of stress, long days, unfair fines, unmet promises of benefits, and harsh managers who used public humiliation as punishment. Foxconn's only response was to add nets to catch future jumpers and to make workers sign pledges that they would not commit suicide; no changes were made to their working conditions. In the following years, the suicides continued though at decreasing rates. Additionally, in 2012, 2016, and 2017, groups of workers gathered on rooftops and threatened to jump if conditions were not improved. While the Foxconn suicides were an extreme example, similar working conditions can still be found in Shenzhen in more recent years. In 2021, a high school student committed suicide after being forced to work in a Shenzhen factory as part of an \u201cinternship.\u201d A group of students at his school was forced, under threat of expulsion, to do manual labor at a Welco Wong's Technology factory instead of the computer training course they were promised. They only received a fraction of the promised pay, 14 yuan per hour, and faced poor working conditions with long hours, night shifts, and bullying from their bosses. In 2021, two workers in high-tech industry jobs at Tencent in Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park committed suicide. Tencent referred to the first suicide as an accident, a claim which was later refuted by current and former workers who revealed that the employee, M\u00e1o X\u012bngy\u00fan, had jumped off the building's roof while working overtime on a Saturday. Many of the workers were convinced that the company was at fault due to their unrealistic expectations and long hours. One employee, fired from Tencent three years ago for refusing to work overtime, described working conditions as \u201cdismal\u201d and \u201ctoxic\u201d, prompting his own suicidal thoughts. Just seven months prior, an intern at one of Tencent's subsidiaries committed suicide in the same location. The combination of such working conditions and employee protests once earned Shenzhen the title of labor protest capital of China but, recently, protests have decreased. In 2015, there were 75 worker protests; in 2019, there were 11. Within Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park, there was a strike in September 2017 organized by workers at Tungtex and another one in June 2018 over a construction project. In 2021, the government proposed harsh changes to Shenzhen's employee payment and work regulations. This is the first time in 17 years that Shenzhen amended its rules on worker pay. These amendments will disempower workers by reducing overtime pay, tightening bonus rules, extending deadlines for paying employees, and slowing the scheduled increases of Shenzhen's minimum wage. As of June 2021, Shenzhen's minimum wage was 2,480 yuan per month, an income level at which it is almost impossible to live in Shenzhen. The Shenzhen government explained that their intentions were to lower wages in order to prompt more hiring in post-pandemic times. While the government acknowledged that these policies disadvantage workers, they claimed that the changes would benefit workers in the long term. It is also of note that economic policies are often tested in Shenzhen before being implemented elsewhere in China and some have speculated that these policy changes could indicate a coming overhaul of China's national labor laws. Conclusion Shenzhen is often used as a testing ground for policies that will later be implemented throughout China. The city itself was designated China's first Special Economic Zone in 1980, making it a test site for Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms. From 1979 to 1990, the Shenzhen SEZ passed over 400 pieces of economic legislation that were highly influential on national economic legislation. These measures included groundbreaking reforms to the tax and finance system, the wage system, the price system, the commodities circulation system, and the labor contract system, all of which were later copied throughout China. Shenzhen also led China in reforming land tenure, state-owned enterprises, and labor markets. Under these policies, Shenzhen grew at an unprecedented rate, rapidly transitioning from a rural fishing village to a large manufacturing hub. Since then, hundreds of cities have been built using the \u201cShenzhen Model\u201d. The trend of Shenzhen as a testing ground has continued in multiple policy areas including environmental policy, working conditions policy, and other economic policies. For example, Shenzhen was chosen as one of the eight cities in which the Chinese government piloted its low carbon policies; it is now endorsed as both a \u201clow carbon pilot city\u201d and a \u201clow carbon ecological demonstration city\u201d. More recently, Shenzhen is taking the lead as a testing ground for a series of environmental policies including the development of electric vehicles, promotion of low-emission public transportation, and stricter pollution regulation. Additionally, China's national social security system was based on Shenzhen's and, in 2001, Shenzhen became the first city to give workers pensions, a practice which was later duplicated throughout China. Based on Shenzhen's history as a policy testing ground, some scholars expect that the policy and industry development approaches taken in Shenzhen since 2015 will soon be implemented across the country. If the Chinese government continues to look at Shenzhen as a testbed for wider policies, then the impacts of MIC25 in Shenzhen will shape Chinese industrialization policies moving forward. Our findings indicate that in Shenzhen, MIC25 has promoted industrial development, but almost entirely within the city's preexisting industries. How the Chinese government crafts future policies based on these results remains to be seen.

{"article":"Analyzing Refugee Vehicle Movements in Eastern Ukraine.json","text":"Ukraine  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors \"Trust But Verify:\" Analyzing Refugee Vehicle Movements in Eastern Ukraine  In partnership with \n The Global (Dis)Information Lab at The University of Texas at Austin \n and written by \n Zachary Daum, \n Raghav Aggarwal, \n Alefia Aziz Ali, \n Kiril Avramov, \n Varij Shah, \n and Taylor Ham  Latest Low Activity at Russia-Ukraine Border Crossings Impact Possible Disinformation from Russian State Media Published May 24 2022 7\u00a0months, 3\u00a0weeks Go to map  Overview  Commercial satellite imagery analysis of the Russia-Ukraine border suggests that the Russian government may have inflated its claimed number of Ukrainian refugees entering Russia. The Kremlin likely boosted official statistics on accepted Ukrainian refugees to present a positive image of the war to Russian citizens and Russian speakers to justify operations in Ukraine. Traffic volumes of commercial and civilian vehicles represent a proxy for indications of refugee flows out of Ukraine. Since the beginning of the war, most Russia-Ukraine border checkpoints have not seen a substantial increase in refugee inflows or traffic compared to border checkpoints in Western Ukraine. An accurate picture of the numbers of refugees can help other countries, NGOs, and relief organizations prioritize resources and areas where refugees are truly located. Activity The Global Disinformation Lab at the University of Texas at Austin used commercial satellite imagery and open reporting to study refugee movements in response to the war in Ukraine. This Tearline article analyzes seven border crossings on the Russia-Ukraine border, and one on the Poland-Ukraine border, for differences in traffic patterns indicative of refugees fleeing Ukraine. Imagery analysis shows that civilian and commercial traffic has not substantially increased and has largely decreased at the Russia-Ukraine border since the beginning of the war. While there are limitations to estimating accurate numbers for refugees with imagery, our evaluation shows that Russian state media has likely misreported the numbers of refugees entering the country since the beginning of the war. To determine this, we compared pre-war and current imagery of crossings along the Russia-Ukraine border for changes in activity. In addition, the imagery of the Ukrainian border with Poland acts as a baseline for expected refugee movements throughout this crisis. Article  Timeline  Graphs  Polish Border Crossing - Korczowa-Krakowiec In order to establish a baseline for refugee activity after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we determined that a comparison needed to be made between claimed border crossings facilitating large movements of people. For Western Ukraine, Poland provides a case study. On March 18th, 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that 42,273 refugees entered Poland through the six border crossings with Ukraine. Imagery analysis of the Korczowa-Krakowiec border crossing, one of the border crossings closest to UNHCR humanitarian centers, on that date shows a sizable queue of civilian and commercial vehicles. Using 13 images analyzed post-invasion, an average of 95 cars and 110 trucks can be observed crossing from Ukraine to Poland. This is in contrast to an average of 31 cars and 60 trucks pre-invasion from August 2018 to January 2021.

Claim #1 - On March 26th, Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (PS FSB) reported that 16,000 civilians crossed from Donbas into the Rostov Region. Russian Border Crossing - Kuibyshevo Imagery analysis of the Kuibyshevo border from March 2020 to November 2021, exemplified by the November 18th, 2021 image, suggests a decrease in overall traffic volume following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as shown in the March 26th image. Before the invasion, there is consistent evidence of significant civilian and commercial traffic, primarily flowing from Ukraine into Russia. Before the invasion, images taken between March 2020 and November 2021, show an average of approximately 32 cars and 23 trucks over 20 images. Kuibyshevo border crossing pre- and post-invasion.

Additional Context: Our analysis suggests that lower post-invasion activity trends continue to hold across the Chertkovo, Gukovo, and Novoshakhtinsk border crossings. Before analyzing each border crossing individually, it is important to note that these three border crossings are the farthest from the main population centers of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, such as the Ukrainian cities of Donetsk, Luhansk, Horlivka, Alchevsk, Khrustalnyi, and Makiivka. These include cities with populations over 50,000 people. Chertkovo was the only crossing located outside of the territory of the self-proclaimed People's Republics before the invasion. Based on this analysis, we expect with moderate confidence that fewer civilians would be traveling to these specific border crossings from Ukraine. Chertkovo Border Crossing Chertkovo Border Crossing. Google Earth Pro 2020.  Novoshakhtinsk Border Crossing Novoshakhtinsk Border Crossing. Google Earth Pro 2020.  Gukovo Crossing Imagery analysis over a period from March 2021 to September 2021 showed an average of 28 cars and 33 trucks. No imagery was available for analysis post-invasion. However, the Gukovo crossing is located between the Novoshakhtinsk and Donetsk (Izvarino) border crossings, with the nearest significant population center located at Dovzhansk with a population of approximately 62,000 people. For all other urban centers with over 50,000 people in Eastern Ukraine, like Khrustalnyi, Luhansk, and Alchevske, the Novoshakhtinsk or Donetsk border crossings would be closer to travel to via major highways, as can be seen in the map above. For this reason, we would expect minimal traffic at the Gukovo crossing, in line with what we have observed at the other crossings. In total With these seven border crossings considered, the number of refugees entering Russia from Ukraine after February 24th, 2022 is likely far short of the 1.2 million refugees claimed by the Russian government. This is evidenced by the minimal traffic at automobile border crossings between the Donbas region of Ukraine and the Rostov Oblast in the Russian Federation. It is important to note that there are multiple alternative methods for evacuating refugees and evacuees: pedestrian (for immediate vicinity to operational border checkpoints) and air and rail transportation. However, it is well-established that air transportation over Ukraine has been closed to all commercial air traffic since the Russian invasion. As for the possibility of evacuations by rail transportation, we next analyzed imagery of the Port of Mariupol. Lastly, pedestrian foot traffic analysis with imagery can prove difficult unless people are bunched in large crowds or long lines. No crowds or lines were observed.

Concluding Analysis of Russian State and State-Affiliated Media Claims and Imagery Evidence The Russian invasion of Ukraine created one of the worst humanitarian disasters in modern-day Europe, with over 6.3 million people displaced since February 24th, 2022. Additionally, the UNHCR has reported, based on data from the Russian government, that 105,000 people crossed into Russia from Donbas between February 18th and February 24th, 2022. Since the beginning of the war, most Russia-Ukraine border checkpoints have not seen a substantial increase in refugee inflows (represented by crowded or busy-looking vehicle activity on imagery) compared to border checkpoints in Western Ukraine. Based on official reporting by the Russian state or state-affiliated media and imagery analysis of border crossing points between Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Poland, it becomes fairly apparent that traffic activity between Ukraine and Russia has been modest. Despite the official claims of the Russian government, it is likely the number of people leaving Ukraine for Russia post-February 24th might be significantly smaller than the 1.2 million refugees claimed by Russia state-backed media outlets. We assess with moderate confidence that the refugee numbers may be overstated based on the observed low activity at the border. According to TASS, a Russian state-owned news agency, Russia has accepted over 1.1 million Ukrainian refugees as of May 4th. However, based on imagery analysis, official Russian statistics on Ukrainian refugees may be inflated, and authorities may be deliberately conflating the numbers prior and post-invasion in accounting for the total numbers of refugees and evacuees since April 2014 and not only since February 2022. The Russian authorities may be using this \u201csmall print\" public maneuver for dramatic effect to present a more positive image of the war to Russian-speaking audiences. The Kremlin also may be utilizing this strategy to bolster the support for the invasion and fortify the framing of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine as innocent victims whose suffering and pleas at the hands of a neo-Nazi regime since 2014 justify the Russian intervention currently. Simultaneously, such claims aim to evoke sympathy, solidarity, and fortification of the support base and infrastructure in border regions, such as Rostov oblast, and ultimately \u201crally around the flag\u201d effects supporting Putin's decision to attack Ukraine. Our analysis concentrated on TASS's English reports because heir articles covered refugee and evacuee movements in a fairly consistent periodic manner and included numbers that could be fact-checked against imagery. Other Russian state-affiliated news outlets, such as Channel One Russia and RIA Novosti, made broad claims and reporting relied on aggregate numbers, which were harder to use in our analysis. TASS is also the largest and most well-known news agency in Russia, registered as a Federal State Unitary Enterprise. The Government of Russia owns business entities registered with this title, thus making TASS a state-owned news agency. Along with Russia Today and RIA Novosti, the U.S. State Department identified TASS as a critical player in the Russian government's disinformation and propaganda ecosystem. Throughout the invasion of Ukraine, publications by TASS have aligned with Kremlin-backed narratives to promote the conflict to Russian citizens. These narratives generally portray Ukraine and Western governments as instigators of the conflict, the Russian Armed Forces as a liberating force, and Ukrainian civilians as welcoming Russia's intervention. Notes 1. We assumed an average of five people per vehicle crossing the border. We over-estimated the number of people that can reasonably fit into a truck cab but believe even with this over-estimate, it highlights the likely over-estimated nature of Russian claims. Moreover, this is based on a snapshot in imagery and the count could likely increase with more collection, but we wanted to supply the reader with a simple, estimated vehicle-to-people conversion.

{"article":"Exploring Chinas Footprint in the Andes Mountains_ Copper Mining in Ecuador.json","text":"China's Belt and Road Initiative  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Exploring China\u2019s Footprint in the Andes Mountains: Copper Mining in Ecuador  In partnership with \n College of William & Mary \n and written by \n Caroline Morin, \n Sophie Pittaluga, \n Charles Pritz, \n and Zak Zeledon  Latest mixed record of operational success Impact local resistance can halt mine operation Published Mar 11 2022 10\u00a0months Go to map  Overview  Ecuador's desire to become a global exporter of copper coincides with increased Chinese demand for and investment in copper mining. Both copper mines in Ecuador are owned by the same Chinese company. The inauguration of mine construction and activity has led to negative environmental damage and forced relocations of indigenous communities at both mines. Despite these similarities, the Mirador mine is operational while the San Carlos-Panantza mine is indefinitely delayed. The only observable difference between the two is that CRCC-Tongguan, the Chinese company involved, has significantly invested in the communities around the Mirador mine. In contrast, community relations at the San Carlos-Panantza mine have been marred by violence.  Activity This article examines one operational and one proposed copper mine in Ecuador. Part two of this series discusses Chinese-financed copper mines in Peru. Article  Timeline  Graphs  In this study, we focus on the interplay between China's geopolitical ambitions, industrial supply chains, and copper mining activity in South America. Copper is an important mineral used in the manufacturing of electrical equipment, building materials, and industrial machinery. Open pit mining is currently the most widely used technique, extracting copper ore near the Earth's surface rather than digging underground. However, open pit mining can have harmful environmental impacts. Tailings dams, which cause tailings ponds, frequently accompany copper mining projects; they store toxic waste extracts that can seep into bedrock or other bodies of water if not disposed of properly and are reported to negatively impact local communities around the world. In 2020, China consumed 54% of global refined copper and imported almost $50 billion USD worth of copper and copper products, making it by far the largest importer of copper. China's rising copper demand parallels the country's focus on migrating to renewable energy sources, electric vehicle production, and other high-tech manufacturing. Copper demand in China is anticipated by academics to increase threefold from 2016 to 2050. China's desire to diversify, secure, and increase its supply of copper has led to investments through the development of mines in the Andean copper belt. This strong desire for a secure copper supply chain is visible in the Andean copper mines of Peru and Ecuador.\u00a0 Despite indefinite delays in construction and operation of some mines, China remains heavily financially involved in these mines, indicating a strong desire for copper. Figure 1 - China's Copper Mines in Peru & Ecuador  Methodology This study utilized text-based data, commercial imagery, and land cover data to analyze all mines with publicly identified information regarding Chinese engagement. The land cover data is from the European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellite. Supplied with this study are downloadable spreadsheets that ark the studied Belt and Road Initiative projects as official, informal, or private Chinese money and ther structured observations.\u00a0 Locational files such as MZ and hapefiles are available for download that were mappable. Ecuador's relationship with China & Copper Mining Industry Ecuador seeks to establish itself as a main exporter of minerals, starting with increasing the amount of copper exported annually. With the goal of being able to export copper at an industrial scale and generate billions of dollars in revenue, copper extraction and production is being led by Chinese enterprises investing in the country. In 2019, Ecuador exported $267,000 USD worth of refined copper to China, 5% of Ecuador's total exports, leaving substantial room for export growth. In Ecuador, the two Chinese-owned projects are the San Carlos-Panantza and Mirador mines. Both mines are currently owned and managed by Corriente Resources, a subsidiary of the China Railway Construction Corporation-Tongguan (CRCC-Tongguan) conglomerate. The two mines are located in the Cordillera del Condor mountain range, approximately 45 km apart. This area is the territory of the indigenous Shuar community\u00a0and is rich in biodiversity. Both sites faced opposition from local indigenous communities, yet in Mirador mine's case, CRCC-Tongguan was able to override resistance and begin mining operations. San Carlos-Panantza: Indigenous Protests Successfully Delayed the Mine The San Carlos and Panantza copper mines commonly referred to as a singular concession due to their proximity (within 5 km), are two open pit porphyry copper\/gold deposits. Since 2010, CRCC-Tongguan has owned the mine. The San Carlos-Panantza mine has faced frequent resistance from local residents and indigenous communities, claiming that the government failed to adequately consult them about projects. The turmoil is largely between the Ecuadorian government and indigenous communities, not Chinese companies, and the government\u2019s lack of communication about the role that \"mining should play in the development of the economy.\"\u00a0Resistance began in August 2016 when 32 Shuar community members of San Marcos of the Nankint community in the parish of Santiago de Panantza were displaced to make room for mine construction activities by ExplorCobres S.A. (EXSA), a subsidiary of CRCC-Tongguan (See Figure 2 overview). The Ecuadorian police carried out this forced removal of the community. The community retaliated by partially invading the mine's territory and destroying a nearby EXSA camp that\u00a0caused the San Carlos-Panantza mine to temporarily shut down. Resistance continued following the initial trigger as the local community filed actions in Ecuador's courts. The Shuar people filed a lawsuit following the forced relocation, demanding EXSA drop the mining project and provide reparations for the displacement of the indigenous community. A provincial court dropped the case in 2019. The violent resistance combined with the court battle led to EXSA halting the project indefinitely in 2018. Figure 2 - Location of San Carlos-Panantza mine  Violent resistance did not cease with EXSA's 2018 delay announcement. On March 28 2020, EXSA's Esperanza camp, which is within San Carlos-Panantza, was intentionally set on fire and ransacked by the Nankint community. Today, on top of the ongoing\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic, EXSA has expressed that the conditions on the ground are not suitable to resume work. Commercial imagery confirms that no mining activity is present at the site as of February 2022 (evident in Figure 2). Satellite detection of land utilization in the area surrounding the San Carlos-Panantza mine further confirms this analysis. The land cover\/use data represented in Figure 3 confirms that the location selected for the mine remained undeveloped as of 2020 with minimal developed areas. Figure 3 - Land cover around the San Carlos-Panantza mine, at a 10-meter resolution  China remains financially involved in the San Carlos-Panantza mine, but the violent actions of the Ecuadorian police and the local community combined with the legal battle have made it difficult for EXSA to develop the mine. By fulfilling communities' requests to halt mines, Ecuador could lose ground in generating revenue from those mines. Moreover, China's exports would be reduced as well. The sentiments expressed at the San Carlos-Panantza mine are reflective of the rest of the country. Ecuador's electoral court held a referendum in February 2021 where voters expressed their opinions on whether or not mining should be outlawed near rivers that run through urban areas because of fears of environmental degradation. In the city of Cuenca, located near the San Carlos-Panantza mine, 80% of citizens voted to prohibit mining to protect their environment and water sources. If the Ecuadorian government wishes to fulfill its goal of increasing copper export capacity, it needs to improve its work on getting buy-in from local populations. Mirador Mine: Operational Mine in Spite of Indigenous Protests Mirador mine is the first open pit mine and one of the largest mines in Ecuador. In 2019, it was projected to produce nearly 94,000 tons of copper annually. The Chinese CRCC-Tongguan consortium acquired Mirador mine in May 2010, then two years later in March 2012, signed a contract with the Ecuadorian government to begin extraction from the mine. However, evidence of mining activity is not visible in commercial imagery until December 2014, as shown in Figure 4. The first imagery evidence of the tailings pond is in 2020 (also shown in Figure 4). The appearance of the tailings pond indicates that the extraction of copper began on schedule following the 2019 construction of supporting infrastructure. Figure 4 - Progression of Mirador mine construction  Beginning in 2009, residents of the Shuar community\u00a0were relocated to make room for Mirador mine's tailings pond. Sixteen families were forcibly removed in the middle of the night by mine workers and the Ecuadorian police. This forced relocation mirrors the events at the San Carlos-Panantza mine, however, CRCC-Tongguan was successful in overcoming indigenous attempts to halt mining operations at Mirador mine.\u00a0 Continued resistance from local communities is rooted in concerns about the health impacts and hazards that mining poses to their community. Water downstream from the Mirador mine in the Zamora River is reported by indigenous activists to be murky and brown, which they attribute to activity at the Mirador mine. On commercial imagery, shown in Figure 5, a clear change in the color of the river is visible over time from a dark blue-green prior to mining activity to a light tan in 2021 nominally indicating a deterioration of water quality. However, this light tan color is visible in water both upstream and downstream from the mine. This evidence of upstream water pollution suggests that there is environmental degradation in the area that is not necessarily attributable to the mine. While there is significant literature about copper mines' negative impact on local water sources, commercial imagery analysis cannot effectively make an assessment on whether the Mirador mine is contributing to water pollution of the Zamora river. Figure 5 - Degradation in water quality of Zamora River  A partially contributing factor to continued mining operations, in the face of resistance between the two Ecuadorian mines, coincides with EcuaCorriente's involvement in the local communities impacted by the Mirador mine. According to mining industry reporting and EcuaCorriente-supplied interviews and information, the mine has generated over 12,400 jobs, directly and indirectly. On its Facebook page, EcuaCorriente consistently posts graphics touting job creation at Mirador mine and links these hiring practices to EcuaCorriente's\u00a0social commitment to the Zamora Chinchipe province. Posts on this page frequently feature hashtags such as #MiningWithResponsibility and #MiningIsDevelopment, which are also present on the San Carlos Panantza mine's page. Furthermore, EcuaCorriente makes an annual financial investment in communities adjacent to Mirador mine to train local Ecuadorian employees in business practices with the stated goal of promoting a relationship of \"friendly cooperation\" between China and Ecuador. Figure 6 - A February 2022 post from the EcuaCorriente Mirador mine Facebook page. The image advertises a Community Work Assistant position and says \"ECSA is looking for you\" (translated from Spanish). The post's caption and usage of the Spanish language clearly indicate that the job position is designated for a member of the local communities.  In August 2021, Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso decided, through an executive decree, to speed up strategic mining projects with the goal of Ecuador becoming a copper powerhouse. Ecuador is trending in this direction as mining exports in 2021 increased 99% from 2020, according to Ministry of Energy reports. Foreign investors, including Chinese enterprises, will play a driving role in determining Ecuador's ability to realize this goal. China itself is incentivized to invest in Ecuador's copper industry as China attempts to grow and diversify its sources of copper. In 2020, NASDAQ found that copper produced at the Mirador mine was exported directly to China. However, for foreign investors to successfully aid Ecuador in its copper exporting goals, the state must work with local populations. As shown by the San Carlos-Panantza mine example, local communities have the power to prevent mine construction.\u00a0 Feb. 1, 2021 Cuenca votes to prohibit mining in the surrounding areas Source(s): \n Mongabay, Consulta popular en Cuenca: \u00bfuna victoria contra la miner\u00eda o el inicio de otra batalla legal? , \n Reuters, Strife with indigenous groups could derail Ecuador's drive to be a mining power  READ MORE  Dec. 1, 2020 First appearance of tailings pond at Mirador mine Source(s): \n Satellite imagery  READ MORE  March 1, 2020 Esperanza Camp, part of the San Carlos-Panantza mine, intentionally set on fire Source(s): \n Mining.com, Corriente Resources\u2019 mining camp in Ecuador set on fire  READ MORE  July 1, 2019 Commercial production begins at the Mirador mine Source(s): \n Minga Service, Proyecto Mirador de Ecuacorriente en producci\u00f3n  READ MORE  Feb. 1, 2019 Shuar community files lawsuit against EXSA regarding San Carlos-Panantza mine  Source(s): \n Amazon Watch, Ecuadorian Indigenous People File Legal Action Over Rainforest Mining Project  READ MORE  Jan. 1, 2019 Provincial court drops the Shuar's community San Carlos-Panantza mine lawsuit Source(s): \n Reuters, Strife with indigenous groups could derail Ecuador's drive to be a mining power  READ MORE  Jan. 1, 2018 EXSA claims to halt mining operations indefinitely at San Carlos-Panantza mine Source(s): \n Reuters, Strife with indigenous groups could derail Ecuador's drive to be a mining power  READ MORE  Jan. 1, 2018 Ecuador joins China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative Source(s): \n AidData, Banking on the Belt and Road  READ MORE  Nov. 1, 2016 Shuar people invade the San Carlos-Panantza mine in an effort to halt operations Source(s): \n Dialogo Chino, The Ghost of Nankints  READ MORE  Aug. 1, 2016 Nankint community forcibly removed from Santiago de Panantza  Source(s): \n Mongabay, Conflict erupts between Chinese mining company, government and indigenous communities in Ecuador  READ MORE  Dec. 1, 2014 Initial signs and stages of mining activity present at the Mirador mine Source(s): \n Satellite Imagery  READ MORE  Sept. 1, 2013 China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative begins Source(s): \n AidData, Banking on the Belt and Road  READ MORE  March 1, 2012 EcuaCorriente signs a contract to begin extraction at the Mirador mine Source(s): \n GARN, The case for Rights of Nature in face of the Mirador Open Pit Copper Mining Project  READ MORE  May 1, 2010 China Railway Construction Corporation-Tongguan acquires the Mirador mine Source(s): \n Carnegie, Chinese Mining and Indigenous Resistance in Ecuador  READ MORE  Jan. 1, 2010 China Railway Construction Corporation-Tongguan obtains San Carlos-Panantza mine Source(s): \n Carnegie, Chinese Mining and Indigenous Resistance in Ecuador  READ MORE  Jan. 1, 1994 Mirador mine discovered Source(s): \n Reuters, Ecuador se lanza a la miner\u00eda de gran escala con proyecto de cobre en Amazonas  READ MORE  About the Studied Copper Mines Activity Name Location Approximate Cost (USD) Chinese Acquisition date Start date of construction Activity Status Proposed annual copper production amount Mirador mine Zamora Chinchipe Province, Ecuador 1 billion  05\/2010 12\/2014 Operational Between 80,000 and 85,000 tons San Carlos-Panantza mine Morona Santiago Province, Ecuador 3 billion  2010 N\/A Construction Proposed Expected to produce 209,000 tons Toromocho mine Junin Region, Peru 2.8 billion  06\/2007 07\/2011 Operational 182,288 tons of refined copper Las Bambas mine Apurimac Region, Peru 5.85 billion  2014 2014 Operational 311,020 tons of copper concentrate  Don Javier mine Arequipa Region, Peru 0.6 billion  Unknown 9\/2003 Operational Unknown El Galeno mine Cajamarca Region, Ecuador 2.5 billion  04\/2009 N\/A Construction Proposed Expected to produce 144,353 tons of refined copper Rio Blanco mine Piura Region, Peru 0.88 billion  04\/2007 N\/A Construction Proposed Expected to produce 200,000 tons Source: \n Original work by W&M geoLab  Chinese Partners of Studied Copper Mines Activity Name Funder(s) Funding Partner(s) Information Implementer(s) Implementing Partner(s) Information Notes Mirador mine CRCC-Tongling (a joint venture) Joint venture comprised of Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise) and the China Railway Construction Company (under the direct leadership of China's State Council) Ecuacorriente S.A.

{"article":"Sanctions Delay Chinese Equipment to Russian Arctic Energy Projects.json","text":"Arctic  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Sanctions Delay Chinese Equipment to Russian Arctic Energy Projects  In partnership with \n Washington University in St. Louis \n and written by \n Seth Stevenson \n and Matt Jones  Latest China projects in the Russian Arctic delayed Impact Sanctions impacting Arctic activity Published Oct 25 2022 2\u00a0months, 2\u00a0weeks Go to map  Overview  Chinese investments in Russian Arctic energy projects are facing complications due to sanctions on Russia. Western sanctions against Russia due to their invasion of Ukraine have resulted in delays to the joint Russia-China Arctic Liquified Natural Gas 2 project. Sanctions appear to be impacting Chinese companies' ability to secure specific western technologies used in LNG processing structures known as \"trains\" and access to mostly western company-owned and operated ice-hardened transport vessels capable of moving the trains from China to the Arctic. Activity This report uses commercial imagery and open reporting to examine Chinese liquified and natural gas (LNG) investments in the Russian Arctic to illuminate the nature of China and Russia's complicated economic relationship and China's Arctic ambitions. Article  Timeline  Bottom Line: To fuel further economic growth and diversify its energy imports, China has made critical investments in Russian liquid natural gas (LNG) projects in the Arctic. Chinese firms provide both financial capital and outsourced construction to make these projects possible. China's first investment, a joint project with the Russian energy company Novatek, known as Yamal LNG, was completed in 2017. The success of this first project encouraged China to partner with Novatek again for a more ambitious project dubbed Arctic LNG 2. In this project, Chinese firms not only invested but are heavily involved in fabricating key components. But progress on Arctic LNG 2 slowed and in some places was halted altogether following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Despite project owner Novatek stating that the first modules for the project's second phase were to arrive in Murmansk in May 2022, imagery analysis shows that as late as September 2022, many of the Chinese-manufactured modules were still sitting in Chinese docks.1 This report captures images from four Chinese construction companies and Novatek's construction yard to demonstrate module construction and transport of components necessary for Arctic LNG 2 is behind deadlines, indicating that one of China's most important forays into the Arctic may be at risk. Background: China's Arctic Ambitions China's growing economy and limited energy resources make it the world's leading importer of oil and natural gas. Approximately 80% of these resources pass through the Strait of Malacca, controlled by the US-aligned Singapore, resulting in a potential choke point that the U.S. could leverage against China. This \"Malacca Dilemma\" drove China to diversify its import sources in order to improve its energy security. In order to achieve this, China seeks a closer economic partnership with Russia, particularly regarding access to Russia's energy deposits above the Arctic Circle. As climate change increases access to the Russian Arctic, China is seeking leverage in the region through investments by Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOE). These investments come at a fortuitous time for Russia as Europe piles sanctions on Russian energy. Chinese SOEs are filling the funding gap that Europe is leaving behind. China's goals extend beyond energy. Despite having no territory in the Arctic, China seeks to establish itself as a key actor in Arctic affairs. While China is not one of the eight nations that possess territory in the Arctic, it claims to have an important stake in the region and calls itself a \"near Arctic state.\" These investments also develop China's relationship with perhaps its most important geopolitical partner: Russia. Russia's need for economic support in the face of new sanctions combined with China's need for energy and Arctic influence make them logical partners. These overlapping interests offer an opportunity to test their \"no-limit partnership.\" By providing critical capital and outsourced labor, China supports Russian firms in their development of Arctic infrastructure while also pursuing core Chinese national interests. China's First Big Investment: Yamal LNG Figure 1 - Yamal LNG Overhead. Image Credit: Google Earth 2022.  China's first practical effort at achieving its Arctic energy goals was its investment in Novatek's Yamal LNG project in 2013 (fig. 1). Located at Sabetta on the Yamal Peninsula, Yamal LNG started in 2005 when Novatek purchased the gas field it sits on from Tamanneftegaz (website not secure), a Russian energy and logistics company operating in the Arctic. The project is a joint venture, with an array of actors. Yamal LNG's investment breakdown shows Novatek with a majority 50.1% stake and Chinese firms with a 29.9% stake. A French company, TotalEnergies, holds a 20% stake. Yamal remains operational as of 2022, however its exports to Europe, currently its most important customer, have declined by 13% month per month as European countries move away from importing Russian energy due to sanctions. ARCTIC LNG 2 Background Figure 2 - Arctic LNG 2 project site. Copyright Maxar 2022. Given the seeming success of Yamal, China also invested in Arctic LNG 2, Novatek's second project in the Arctic (fig. 2). LNG 2 is situated on the Utrenneye Field across the Gulf of Ob from Yamal LNG. Chinese firms own a 20% stake in the project, making them Novatek's largest partner. A consortium of Japanese companies own a smaller 10% stake and French TotalEnergies the remaining 10%. However, these firms came under pressure to relinquish their involvement after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. TotalEnergies announced its exit in March 2022. Japanese firms, while more hesitant to exit, either suspended or wrote off their involvement. While Arctic LNG 2 is not yet operational, Chinese firms already contracted for its future supply. In 2021, three Chinese SOEs signed contracts for close to 40 million tons of LNG over 20 years from the facility. Planned Progress vs. Reality Construction on Arctic permafrost is difficult and resource intensive. To mitigate both the environmental and fiscal challenges, the plan is for Arctic LNG 2's components to be fabricated in Russia and China, transported to the Arctic, and then constructed atop gravity-based structures (GBS). A train is a complex structure that intakes raw gas condensate and transforms it into pure liquid natural gas. Each Arctic LNG 2 train is designed to produce 6.6 metric tons per annum (MTPA) of LNG, for a total 19.8 MTPA of LNG for the whole project. A train consists of fourteen modules, which are massive, prefabricated structures that facilitate the rapid construction of LNG processing plants. The Arctic LNG modules are being constructed at up to seven yards\u2014one in Murmansk, Russia, and as many as six in China\u2014and then shipped to Murmansk for installation on the concrete foundations. Project subcontractors are constructing the GBS foundations in two dry docks at Novatek's construction center in Murmansk. By comparing the design concepts published by Novatek with commercial imagery, we assess that construction of the components largely proceeded as scheduled, but their transport to the Arctic is delayed. The design concepts are shown in Figures 3 a and b below. Figure 3a - Novatek concept drawing of completed LNG trains in operation. Image Credit: Novatek.  Previous Next  Using the images in Figure 3 as a benchmark for measuring progress on LNG Train 2, we assess that: The modules are too heavy for a crane and must slide onto the GBS, so they must be installed in order from back to front, as demonstrated in Figure 4a. There is limited space at Novatek's construction yard to temporarily store modules before they are installed. As such, with two known exceptions, the order in which modules are shipped generally follows the order in which they are installed. Trains 1 and 2 are the same design and the Chinese fabricators are building the same modules for both, so the order of shipments is likely to be the same. Figure 4a - Train 1 in the middle of module installation, March 6, 2022. Though not in the picture, one Bomesc module is known to be on site because it shipped with another.

Previous Next  Delayed Transport from Chinese Module Manufacturers Based on the insights gleaned from the concept plans, we evaluated imagery and press releases from Chinese firms to determine whether the projects were proceeding as planned. While much of the fabrication at the Chinese and Russian facilities is complete, we assess that transport to the Arctic is delayed. Wison Offshore Engineering Module Development (Zhoushan, Zhejiang) Coordinates: 30\u00b011'25.61\"N, 122\u00b012'9.59\"E Wison's contributions to Arctic LNG 2 form the core of each LNG train's module assemblage and thus must be installed first, as evidenced by the construction of Train 1. Despite a predicted installation date of May 2022, Wison's second batch of modules bound for Train 2 was still in the construction yard in August 2022, providing imagery evidence that Arctic LNG 2 is behind schedule. Wison appears to be responsible for constructing at least eight modules in total. The first four modules (fig. 5) were shipped in August and September of 2021 (fig. 6). Figure 6 - First Modules preparing to leave Wison Construction Yard, August 19th, 2021. Image Credit: Energy Voice. In May, 2022, the month Novatek predicted modules would begin arriving, Wison had four modules intended for Train 2 remaining in their construction yard (fig. 7a). Using the imagery of Train 1 as a reference, these modules appear to be complete (fig. 3c). As of August 9, the modules have still not shipped (fig. 7b). Figure 7a - Completed modules for Train 2 at Wison Construction Yard, May 21, 2022. Image Credit: Google Earth.  Previous Next  Given their place at the beginning of the installation order, their continued presence at Wison until at least August 2022 indicates Novatek is approximately three months behind its goal of beginning Train 2 module installations. However, given that Cosco Heavy Transport is currently transporting other modules that come later in the installation order, it is possible that these modules have shipped since August 9, 2022 (latest available imagery). Bomesc Module Development (Harbor Economic Area, Tianjin) Coordinates: 38\u00b056'9.96\"N, 117\u00b045'28.27\"E Bomesc's contributions to Arctic LNG 2 are mostly complete. All of its Train 1 modules are installed and two of its Train 2 modules shipped. But there is one module that remains in its construction yard and industry news sources imply that this module is unlikely to move in the near term, further indicating that construction of Train 2 is behind schedule. Bomesc was contracted to construct a total of six modules for the project: three for Train 1 and three for Train 2. Two modules for Train 1 shipped in December 2021, aboard the Cosco Shipping-owned vessel Xin Guang Hua and arrived in mid-January, 2022 (fig. 8). Because of assembly requirements at Murmansk, a third Train 1 module shipped almost concurrently onboard the Red Box Energy Services vessel Audax via the Northern Sea Route, arriving in early February 2022 (fig. 9). Figure 8 - Cosco Shipping vessel Xin Guang Hua leaving Tianjin, China, with two Bomesc modules. December, 2021. Image Credit: Cosco Shipping.  Previous Next  On August 16, 2022, it was reported that two completed modules for Train 2 were loaded onto the Cosco-owned ship Xin Guang Hua. Cosco is moving quickly to deliver these modules before its contract with the project expires. Maritime tracking websites indicate that the Xin Guang Hua is en route from China to Murmansk, with an estimated arrival date of October 18, 2022. As of September 9, 2022, one module bound for Train 2 remains in the construction yard (fig. 10). Since Bomesc's Train 1 modules all shipped at nearly the same time because of assembly requirements in Murmansk, this module's continued presence in Bomesc's construction yard may further indicate that the construction of Train 2, and thus the project, is behind schedule.

Penglai Jutal Offshore Engineering (Penglai, Shandong) Coordinates: 37\u00b048'48.65\"N, 120\u00b050'19.41\"E PJOE's modules for Arctic LNG 2 appear complete, but an absence of typical social media updates about its progress may indicate delays in transport. PJOE is contracted to construct a total of six modules for Trains 1 and 2; Figure 11 shows all six modules under construction in April 2021. According to a PJOE press release and YouTube video, two modules destined for Train 1 shipped on November 6, 2021, while a third shipped on November 27, 2021. Imagery from December 2021 confirms these shipments (fig. 12). Figure 12 - PJOE Yard December 6, 2021. Image Credit: Google Earth.  Based on key identifiers taken from reference images of Train 1 (fig. 13a), the most recent available imagery (March 5, 2022) indicates the three modules for Train 2 were complete (fig. 13b). Figure 13a - Reference shot of module PJOE module completed and installed on Train 1, on July 15, 2022. Copyright Maxar, 2022.  Previous Next  While module construction may be complete, PJOE has not publicly noted progress on the project since December 2021. Prior to that, PJOE posted press releases on its website touting its progress on the project frequently, including when the first modules shipped. It also posted regular and enthusiastic updates on YouTube and LinkedIn on project status. This sustained silence could be an indicator that progress has stalled. It's also possible that PJOE is no longer seeking publicity for its partnership on a Russian project. Qingdao McDermott Wuchuan Module Development (Qingdao, Shangdong) Coordinates: 35\u00b059\u201912.65\u201d N, 120\u00b016\u201941.97\u201d E Delays in transport also affect Qingdao McDermott Wuchuan. While two modules for Train 1 appear to have shipped, as of May 23, 2022, one module for Train 2 remains in the yard\u2013behind Novatek's schedule. McDermott was contracted to construct three liquefaction modules for the project, with two modules bound for Train 1 and the third bound for Train 2 (fig. 14). Figure 14 is from May 2021 and shows the two modules for Train 1 with the module for Train 2 in the early stages of construction evidenced by the multiple module decks waiting to be crane-lifted into position. Two of these shipped in November and December 2021. Figure 14 - McDermott Yard May 1, 2021. Image Credit: Google Earth.  Figure 15 - McDermott Construction Yard May 23, 2022. Image credit: Google Earth.  As modules remain in Chinese construction yards, their assembly into trains is further delayed. The next section uses imagery analysis of Novatek's own construction yard, where these modules are turned into LNG trains, to further demonstrate Arctic LNG 2's delays. Novatek Construction Yard at Murmansk (Belokamenka, Murmansk Oblast) Coordinates: 69\u00b005\u2032N 33\u00b012\u2032E Imagery from July 2022 (latest available imagery) of Novatek's construction areas indicates that Train 1 is prepared for final transport to the Arctic but Train 2 is not. Novatek's plans were to begin module installation in May 2022. Figure 16 - Murmansk Yard March 24, 2022. Copyright Maxar 2022. As of July 15, 2022, Novatek was flooding Train 1's dry dock and the sled used for positioning modules was removed, indicating that the train was being prepared for departure. However, in spite of Novatek's predictions that modules for Train 2 would begin arriving in May 2022, Train 2 appears to have made little progress beyond its concrete foundation (fig. 17) as a result of module delays. Figure 17 - Murmansk Yard July 15, 2022. Copyright Maxar 2022.  Arctic LNG 2's Troubled Future Since the beginning of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, progress on Arctic LNG 2 has slowed. Western-based and western-aligned companies involved in contracting (TechnipFMC and Saipem), construction (Boskalis), and various critical, long-lead technologies (Baker Hughes, Seimens, Linde, and Daewoo), have all ended or are in the process of ending their contracts with the project. Some companies, like Technip, have sought to end all activities in Russia. Technip announced its full exit from the project in October 2022. Even major stakeholders Total S.A. and Matsui have written off the project and will no longer provide additional funds. Additionally, sanctions have likely precluded many of the leading, western-based, heavy-lift companies contracted to transport the modules from China to Murmansk, including Red Box Energy Services, BigLift, and GPO, from participating in the project. Many of these companies specialize in heavy-transport vessels with ice-breaking capabilities, which enabled module transport via the Northern Sea Route (NSR), even in the winter. Without them, the Northern Sea Route may become much less accessible, which could slow progress. This exodus of western companies has left Novatek with gaping holes in the project that it is struggling to fill. This has led Novatek to try to partner with companies like Turkish energy and construction company Karpowership, NIPIgaz-owned Nova Energies, and Green Energy Solutions out of the UAE. Recent news releases indicate Karpowership is considering potential involvement but has not yet signed on. On the module transport side, while Cosco Heavy Transport and other Chinese companies have participated in the project, it remains to be seen whether they or other non-western, heavy-lift companies can fill the void left by western companies. These complications have led to significant delays in the project's progress. Though Train 1 was anticipated to move in the end of 2022, recent industry news articles indicate that Novatek has delayed plans to move Train 1 out of Murmansk until the Summer of 2023. Note 1. Imagery assessments were made with the best available imagery. Some analysis was based on imagery from May and July 2022 and others assessments were from more recent imagery such as from September 2022. Taken aggregately and mixed with open reporting, we argue with moderate confidence that the major trend of shipping delays holds since the February 2022 Ukraine invasion and the sanctions that followed thereafter.

{"article":"The Environmental Impact of Russian Mining in the Central African Republic.json","text":"Russian Influence  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors The Environmental Impact of Russian Mining in the Central African Republic  In partnership with \n College of William & Mary \n and written by \n Caroline Morin, \n Cole Spiller, \n Garrison Goetsch, \n Erin Horrigan, \n Yasha Barth, \n Zoe Roberts, \n Aliia Woodworth, \n Catherine Cable, \n and Anna Glass  Latest Increased activity at mining sites Impact Negative impact on environment Published Dec 16 2021 1\u00a0year Go to map  Overview  Since 2017, Russia has become increasingly involved in the affairs of the Central African Republic (CAR). A recent agreement between the two countries granted the Russian mining company \"Lobaye Invest\" exclusive mineral rights to ore deposits throughout the country. Activity in these sites has resulted in observable environmental degradation in the mining permit areas. There are visible changes in infrastructure, land degradation, deforestation, and water pollution around Russian-linked mining areas, and these developments highlight additional potentially harmful impacts on the population of CAR. Satellite imagery analysis links many of these mining sites to nearby potentially affected population centers and the Lobaye River. Activity This project uses open-source data collection and imagery analysis to study the impacts of Russian activity across multiple Central African countries. This Tearline article examines evidence of eight Russian-owned mining permit areas in the Central African Republic (CAR) and evaluates the environmental impact of Russian involvement in CAR. Imagery analysis shows in the time since the acquisition of the permit areas, mining activity and multiple forms of environmental degradation have increased in the most significant permit areas. While it is difficult to estimate with certainty the depth of Russian involvement in maintaining these mining sites, our evaluation does shed light on the various negative environmental effects that accompany Russian engagement in CAR. Article  Timeline  Graphs  Russian Intervention in the Central African Republic Russian mining operations are causing significant environmental degradation in the Central African Republic. These mines are not directly owned by the Russian government, but are instead owned by the Russian mining company Lobaye Invest Sarlu (Lobaye Invest). Lobaye Invest is owned by subsidiaries of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a prominent Russian oligarch with direct ties to Vladimir Putin. Additionally another one of Prigozhin's firms, the Russian private military company Wagner Group, known for its engagement in Russia's proxy conflicts, provides security for these mines in addition to fighting alongside CAR forces in the ongoing civil war. Since the company's registration in Bangui in 2017, Lobaye Invest has been awarded at least eight mining permits within CAR. Source of permit  Lobaye Invest and Wagner Group are key entities in the deepening cooperation between CAR and Russia. At the heart of their partnership is the exchange of Russian military support and training by Wagner forces for Russian access to valuable gold and diamond deposits in CAR. This partnership began in 2017 when Lobaye Invest was first registered in Bangui. Beginning in June 2018, Lobaye Invest was granted mining recognition permits throughout the country to identify gold and diamond deposits. Since then, Lobaye Invest has discretely expanded its presence in many major cities throughout CAR. Now, at least eight mining permits have been awarded to Lobaye Invest, with most of the mines they contain being within the Lobaye and Ombella-M'Poko prefectures in western CAR. The largest permits, as visible in the above map, are located to the west of Bangui, and grant the company exclusive mineral rights to the gold and diamond deposits located within each permit. Mining activity is concentrated to the west of Bangui, where the largest permits are located. Together, these mining sites cover 4,025 square kilometers.  The above-described Russia-CAR partnership has developed in the context of the Central African Republic Civil War, which has been ongoing since 2013. A crucial development in the relationship occurred in 2016 when Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra was elected president and was quickly diplomatically courted by Moscow. After a series of initial meetings, Russian diplomats demonstrated a clear intention to gain access to CAR's valuable natural resources in exchange for their military and diplomatic support of the Touad\u00e9ra administration. Such activity in CAR comes as part of a broader Russian diplomatic initiative in Africa. Another pivotal meeting occurred in 2017, when Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and President of the Central African Republic Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra met and discussed\u00a0cooperation in several economic sectors, including mineral exploration. Both parties agreed to strengthen their level of cooperation on diplomatic and military affairs. Since then, Russia's military presence in CAR has been growing. Initially, Moscow appealed to the UN Security Council to bypass the arms embargo on CAR and sent combat instructors to train the Central African Republic's Army (FACA). President Touad\u00e9ra then began to use Wagner mercenaries in his presidential guard and appointed Valery Zakharov - a former Russian GRU officer with direct links to Prigozhin - as his personal national security officer. Since these initial meetings, multiple large contingents of Wagner forces (officially titled \"instructors\" by the Kremlin) have arrived in CAR. Now, Wagner forces are openly fighting alongside the FACA, as happened in the violence following Touad\u00e9ra's 2020 reelection. After Touad\u00e9ra's contentious electoral victory in December 2020, violence spiked as rebel leaders challenged the legitimacy of the elections. A united front of rebels launched an offensive on the capital city of Bangui and seized control of much of Western CAR, but were eventually stopped out by UN and FACA forces. It took the deployment of additional Russian instructors and Rwandan soldiers to aid and stabilize the situation. The FACA, working with a total of at least 300 Russian military personnel and advanced vehicles (Russian-made armored vehicles and helicopters) , reversed the rebels' gains, retaking much of Western CAR. Coincidentally, a majority of Lobaye Invest's mining permits are situated in these recaptured areas, and the reestablishment of government control has allowed further exploitation of these mining sites. Mining in CAR Mining within the Russian permit areas in CAR is primarily conducted through semi-mechanized artisanal mining practices. Artisanal mining is a labor-intensive form of mining with little to no mechanization in which manual diggers exploit alluvial mineral deposits. Semi-mechanized or semi-artisanal mining entails a combination of artisanal and mechanized practices. According to a USAID report on CAR, in 2019 there was an increase in semi-mechanized gold and diamond mining companies working on a small-scale basis. Diamonds in CAR come only from alluvial deposits, while gold is found in both alluvial and hard rock deposits. Alluvial mining of gold and diamonds occurs through both artisanal and semi-mechanized processes. The mining sites in the Russian permit areas in CAR are almost entirely open-pit, alluvial mining sites. The major environmental impacts of these mining practices include deforestation from mining and associated infrastructure, diversion and pollution of water sources, and land degradation. The CAR government currently has little control over the mining sector and many artisanal miners are unaware of the environmental regulations associated with mining. According to a study by IPIS, 53% of miners in CAR believe that gold and diamond resources are infinite and two-thirds of miners believe that mining has no negative impacts on the environment. There is also a significant gap between mining regulations and their implementation. A defunct Ministry of Environment and Ecology regulation provides one example of this gap; it requires a 200-meter buffer zone near streams within which vegetation must be left intact and mining is not allowed. While this rule would protect local water sources, in practice, these rules are not well known and are hardly ever enforced. Based on our findings in the following case studies, Lobaye Invest's mining practices and failure to adhere to basic regulations are contributing to significant environmental damage to CAR. Key Findings These case studies are examples of trends seen across all of the Russian mines analyzed, as shown in our downloadable open atabase. Consistently, Lobaye Invest has demonstrated a disregard for the environmental consequences of mining. The CAR government levies little or no regulations on Russian-owned mining operations, instead focusing on the CAR-Russia military engagement, enabling mining conducted in these permit zones to ignore the potential severity of the environmental consequences. These consequences--most notably with land degradation, deforestation, and water pollution--negatively impact local communities reliant on the surrounding environment. G1 Mine Case Study: A typical Russian-owned Mining Site This mining site demonstrates the typical size, structure, and components of most both open-pit dry and open-pit alluvial mining sites. Generally, Russian-owned mining sites have a negative impact on the environment causing deforestation and harm to water sources. F13 Mine Case Study: Infrastructure Infrastructure development around mining sites can increase the environmental harm of a particular mining activity. This infrastructure is related to the operation of the mine, however, there is evidence of Russian military infrastructure nearby the Russian-owned mining permit areas. F2 Mine Case Study: Mining Cluster Near a River Mines located within 200m of a river, like these mines, can contaminate the Lobaye River as chemical runoff from the mine decreases the pH levels of water and possibly pollutes the river with other harmful chemicals. F4 Mine Case Study: Land Degradation Mines that are not properly rehabilitated after use lead to significant land degradation and leave the land unusable for other key purposes, including agriculture. F4 Mine Case Study: Development of a Mining Cluster\u00a0 When mines are successful, operational and finding large quantities of the mineral, the sites quickly expand into clusters, regardless of environmental features near the expansion. F6 Mine Case Study - Lobaye River Mines Non-rehabilitated inactive mines are found to result in high levels of toxic metal compounds in surface and groundwater resources. Further, stagnant water in these sites can lead to increased rates of communicable diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. Methodology The geoParsing team at William & Mary's geoLab specializes in the merging of text and location-based data on Russian activity across multiple central African countries. The open database accompanying this article (ownloadable as a CSV file) tracks activities by type, date, and location of project locations which were mappable at a high level of precision, typically more detailed than the third administrative boundary level of a country. The eight permit areas obtained through official CAR government documentation were analyzed using satellite imagery (DigitalGlobe and public layers in Google Earth Pro) for potential mining activity. The areas within the boundaries of the permit areas were analyzed and all instances of mining activities were recorded. Each permit area was assigned a letter (A-H), and each individual mine discovered was assigned a specific alphanumeric ID composed of the appropriate permit letter and a unique number. Additionally, time-series analysis showed the progression of the mining sites where extensive damage to flora, water resources, and soil occurred. Environmental Scorecard Each mine was analyzed over a period of five to eight years, depending on the availability of satellite imagery. Land degradation and deforestation were coded by describing visible changes to the land color and the presence of trees and vegetation. The potential for water pollution was measured using the distance from each mining site to the nearest river. Mines within 200 meters of the nearest river were considered contributors to water pollution in accordance with regulations from the Ministry of Environment and Ecology in CAR. For every mine, each form of environmental damage was recorded as present (1) or not present (0). The water pollution category also includes a designation of 0* which signifies that a mine is near a water source, but is not within 200 meters of it. The ownloadable environmental scorecard features only mines discussed as case studies. For a full list of all mines discovered in the eight Lobaye Invest permit areas, please download the open database (SV snapshot). The above table lists the size, mineral content, and the number of known mines in each of the eight permit areas granted to Lobaye Invest. Areas of each permit were calculated using coordinates found in official CAR government documents.  Mining Case Studies Permit map approximated from analysis of Lobaye Invest permits. All of the following mining case studies fall within the permit areas F, G, and H.  G1 Mine Case Study: A typical Russian-owned Mining Site Time-series analysis demonstrates active development of mine G1 after mining permits were granted to Lobaye Invest in 2018.  Comparative satellite images show a typical mine system's development over time. This mine reflects the typical size, structure, and components of a mining site within a Russian-owned permit area in the Central African Republic. It features a small cluster of both open-pit dry and open-pit alluvial mines. Open-pit alluvial mines are characterized by a lighter ring of soil surrounding a pit of groundwater that emerged during the mining process. Alluvial mining involves sifting through mud, sand, or gravel in search of mineral deposits. Active mines close to river beds displace sediment in the ground, flooding the mining pit with light blue or green water. Therefore, light water in an alluvial mine indicates that the mine is active, while dark water indicates that the sediment has settled and the mine is inactive. The impacts of many small-scale activities on local environmental conditions are generally poorly understood. One study by IPIS found that, at 78% of artisanal mining sites in Western CAR, \"the color or smell of the water has changed because of exploitation of the site.\" Compared to alluvial mines, dry mines feature step-like structures and no pool of water at their center. Figure G1.2 features a dry open-pit mine on the far left of the mine system. A dark square lines the interior of the open-pit mine, revealing the step-like structure that miners create to traverse deeper into the pit. On the mine farthest left in figure G1.2, a dark square lines the interior of the open-pit mine, revealing the step-like structure that miners create to traverse deeper into the pit. This mining system, close to Badea and the Lobaye River, shows the development of the mining system over five months. In January 2020, the mine system had one small open-pit alluvial mine. By February, the same pit had expanded in size. In May 2020, the mine system developed into a cluster of smaller mines that were excavated and subsequently became inactive. Many Wagner personnel have been guarding diamond and gold mines to perpetuate government control over the Russian-owned mining permit areas. In the vicinity of these permit areas, increased damage to local water supply and forests from rebel and Russian activity has negatively impacted the population and environment, as seen in the town of Gallo. Further fighting will continue to damage the surrounding environment near the mines that will take years to recover or repair. As seen in figures G1.1 and G1.2, this mining site has prompted deforestation of the surrounding area. As mining efforts progress and minerals are increasingly depleted, mining operations are pushed deeper into forests, resulting in increased deforestation. A study by USAID found that wholesale deforestation occurred at 98% of mining sites in Western CAR \"for the purposes of extending the site (on 308 sites), heating (167 sites), or supporting mine tunnels (153 sites).\" The imagery of this site clearly shows the progression of similar deforestation patterns at Russian-owned mining sites. F13 Mine Case Study: Infrastructure Time-series analysis of mine F13 reveals rapid development from February 2020 to May 2020.  This small mine in figures F13.1 and F13.2 northeast of Bobanga shows the development of a smaller mining system and nearby infrastructure. Mining activities have direct environmental consequences, but infrastructure development can also impact the environment. To operate a mining system, mining companies must build miles of pathway, buildings adjacent to the mine, and housing for the workers. Each of these activities further degrades the surrounding land. Most mine systems within Russian-owned permit areas consist of several small pits, but the system present in figure F13.2 is one large open-pit mine in the center of a small forest. The system also features two smaller craters to the south of the largest mine. In both February and May 2020, there were several new small buildings and trucks near the mining site, indicating an increase in mining infrastructure. The satellite imagery in figure F13.1 from February also features several small buildings to the north of the mine system closer to an intricate road system. The development of infrastructure coincides with the appearance of new mines in the area, indicating that these buildings are likely tied to the operation of the mines. Further analysis of mine F13 shows that the mine is located only 300 meters away from a nearby town. Negative environmental impacts of mines, particularly deforestation and impact on water, can negatively impact a town's population as many small towns rely on the nearby environment for water, food, and economic activities. \u00a0  In addition to the mining-related infrastructure, the Russian contingent in CAR has also begun to build and improve military infrastructure in-country. In early 2018, Russian mercenaries established a training base at the Berengo Estate, not far from these mining areas. Russia has already demonstrated a willingness to quickly increase its presence in CAR, and further development of these mining sites could necessitate a greater Russian ground presence, which in turn could compound observed environmental degradation. The rapid development of these mining areas is tied closely to Russian military presence in CAR, as Russian mercenaries and Russian-trained forces have been instrumental in securing Lobaye Invest's permit areas. F2 Mine Case Study: Mining Cluster Near a River Time-series analysis of mine F2 displays the development of a major mining cluster nearby the Lobaye River.  Figures F2.1 and F2.2 display a large network of mines and their development from December 2014 to May 2020. The mines are west of the town of Boda. The mine network stretches approximately a mile and runs adjacent to the Lobaye River. The varying coloration of the mines is indicative of varying levels of activity. From 2014 to 2020, there was little mining development (only some single-pit mines were added) and the vegetation grew greener and thicker. However, this difference in observed vegetation may be due to the change in season; the imagery from 2011 was taken during CAR's dry season while the 2020 imagery was taken during the rainy season. As a result, satellite imagery of these mines does not tell us much about the level of deforestation. Open-pit mining typically releases heavy metals such as lead, copper, zinc, aluminum, mercury, marcasite, and pyrite into the local ecosystem. This contributes to a decrease in pH levels and water contamination in areas surrounding open-pit mining sites, negatively impacting agriculture, drinking water, and aquatic ecosystems. The mines at site F2 are located within 200 meters of the Lobaye River, meaning that runoff with these harmful chemicals could be leaking from the mining process and affecting nearby populations. F4 Mine Case Study: Land Degradation Time-series analysis of mine F4 highlights extensive land degradation that has occurred at the site. Though the mines have been present since at least 2014, more land degradation has notably occurred in the time since Lobaye Invest was granted ownership in 2018.  The satellite imagery above features a large mine system south of Badea and Lobaye River in Boganda, Central African Republic. A dense cluster of open-pit alluvial mines sits close (within 200 meters) to the riverbed. The satellite imagery from 2014 shows that these mines were likely active, as they are lighter in color and there is evidence of active infrastructure on the edge of the mining site. Satellite imagery from 2020 shows evidence of land degradation from the now inactive mining site. The alluvial mines are now darker in color, indicating that they are inactive. The inactive mines left patches of barren land in the area surrounding the site, and rings of barren land around each now-inactive pit. When abandoned, mining sites are replaced with dark, undisturbed water and arid land. Once mining sites have been exhausted, the excavated pits are typically left uncovered and few measures are taken to rehabilitate the area. Rehabilitation is the process of optimizing land use post-mining and includes reclamation, which addresses soil stability and erosion, and remediation, which focuses on decontamination of mining sites. The methods of rehabilitation begin with the refill of excavated areas and uneven surfaces, removal of garbage, and disposal of hazardous waste. The next step in the rehabilitation process increases soil organic matter content by spreading manure, hay or deadwood to improve soil moisture retention and fertility. Once the soil has been rehabilitated, biological interventions are performed to revegetate the previously degraded area. Failure to rehabilitate mining sites renders the land unusable for other key purposes, such as agriculture. As seen in figure F4.2, active pit mines continue to be created as recently as July 2020,\u00a0 revealing a continued cycle of development and degradation in Russian-owned permit areas.\u00a0 In contrast to alluvial mines, open-pit mines such as those present at mine F4 can also contribute to land degradation through physical soil disturbance, erosion, and the formation of sinkholes. The deeper the mineral deposits, the greater the scale of this degradation. Such degradation leaves land non-arable and unable to contribute to CAR's agriculture sector, which accounts for 34% of CAR's GDP and employs almost 70% of the workforce. F4 Mine Case Study: Development of a Mining Cluster Imagery analysis of two small mines in the northern area of mine F4 demonstrates a lasting impact of unaddressed land degradation, as previously potentially arable land remains scarred by unfilled mines.  Further analysis of site F4 shows the development of a large mine system adjacent to Lobaye River both before and after the Russian acquisition of the permit area. In the 2011 satellite imagery (F4.3), two active mines are visible half a kilometer from the center of what will become a large mine system. Three years later, one active mine emerged along with an extensive road system (4.26 kilometers of pathway stretch from the mining system to the nearest main road). Land degradation, in the form of the loss of previously arable land, is visibly in figure F4.4. 2020, two years after Lobaye Invest acquired the site, the mining site now spans over a kilometer in length, with dozens of active and inactive mines reaching all the way to the nearby Lobaye river.  By 2020, two years after the mine was acquired by Lobaye Invest, the mine system in figure F4.5 expanded to include over one dozen open-pits that span 1.75 kilometers in length. The satellite imagery from 2020 contains both active and inactive pits in the same geographic area. The inactive system sits adjacent to Lobaye River, while the active site lies farther up the road system that leads to the neighboring city, Badea. The inactive mines are small and dense, while each mine in the active system is larger and farther from neighboring pits. This rapid expansion of the mining network by Lobaye Invest is causing severe land degradation, and the proximity of the mines to the river ensures that significant water pollution will take place. Russia's lack of commitment to reversing land degradation further emphasizes that its focus is on rapid economic development and gain. Prior to 2014, Russia had not officially received permit grants to the mining areas and the mines were rather underdeveloped. Following the signing of the permits granting mining access to Russia, in the period between 2014 and 2020, rapid development of mines and the surrounding territory occurred. F6 Mine Case Study - Lobaye River Mines Analysis of mine F6 illustrates the presence of more mining clusters since its 2018 acquisition by Lobaye Invest.  Figures F6.1 and F6.2 show mining development directly adjacent to the Lobaye River and near the town of Yawa. The color of mine pits is indicative that this mine network is plausibly inactive. However, certain pits possibly have blue water in them, indicating some recent mining activity. From 2014 to 2020, there has been substantial development of the mines. In 2014, there were only a handful of pits, however by 2020, there were numerous pits spanning the area below the river. Since the surrounding area is an open field, there was already minimal vegetation at this location. The development of this mining site seems to have had little to no impact on the existing vegetation. Assuming that the majority of the mines at this site are now inactive, figure F6.2 provides further evidence of a lack of rehabilitation efforts post-mining. Furthermore, the lack of Russian commitment to land rehabilitation suggests a disregard for the environmental impact. Russian endeavors appear to be more economically driven than balanced with environmental measures. Failure to refill inactive mines can lead to increased rates of communicable diseases transmitted by mosquitoes such as Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Malaria. When alluvial mines are not rehabilitated and refilled after use, they create areas of stagnant water that are prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Studies throughout Latin America have linked abandoned mines with increased cases of malaria among mine in workers and in surrounding areas. It is likely that these abandoned mines in CAR, a country that already struggles with malaria, would have a similar effect. Lack of rehabilitation also means that any harmful substances used during the mining process further damage the local environment.\u00a0 In 2014, UNESCO conducted a survey of abandoned mines in Sub-Saharan Africa to determine their environmental impacts. The results showed that mining activities resulted in high levels of toxic metal compounds in surface and groundwater resources as well as surrounding soil and vegetation. Chemicals such as mercury and cyanide are used in small-scale gold extraction and pollute surrounding water and land. Wastewater is also created as a part of the alluvial mining process, polluting rivers. Given its proximity to Lobaye River, this mine site likely contaminates the water, harming both the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Mining near water sources also contributes to erosion, which increases siltation and sedimentation in rivers, resulting in reduced fish populations. While the negative effects of chemicals released through these mining practices near the Lobaye River are difficult to quantify, we assess from the general literature of negative impacts that this is occurring in this case and others around the Lobaye River. Conclusion Russian mining activity is negatively impacting the environment in the Central African Republic. While cooperation between Moscow and Bangui is nominally based on military and economic engagement, the environmental impacts of Lobaye Invest's fledgling mining operations are a noteworthy byproduct. Satellite imagery has provided critical insights into how these mines are impacting the environment in CAR. The primary ways that mining has observably damaged the environment are land degradation, deforestation, and water pollution.\u00a0 Since Russian-owned mining operations face little or no regulations, the mining conducted in these permit zones has not been accompanied by efforts to address their environmental impacts, despite their severity. As seen in all five case studies, land degradation is widespread and largely unaddressed throughout Russian-owned permit areas. A failure to properly address continued land degradation could ultimately render large swaths of inactive mining plots unusable in the future and potentially increase the spread of endemic diseases such as Malaria. Rapid deforestation has been observed in case studies G1, F13, and F2, with the effects of deforestation increasing in the years since Lobaye Invest acquired ownership of the sites. Case studies F6 and F2 demonstrate a general disregard for safeguards regarding water pollution, as reckless mining operations continue to expand dangerously close to the Lobaye River. Continued neglect of key environmental safeguards could lead to continued toxic pollution of a key water source.\u00a0 While the issues of land degradation, deforestation, and water pollution are prevalent in CAR, they are also present throughout the sub-Saharan region. If the Russian model of engagement both politically and economically with CAR proves successful, continued Russian outreach will lead to similar mining projects. Such an expansion of mining projects elsewhere could also be accompanied by a lack of environmental regulations, resulting in similar. negative environmental effects throughout the central African region.

{"article":"Russia Reallocates Resources to Filtration Operations Based On Anticipated Flow of Displaced Ukrainian Civilians.json","text":"Ukraine  Title Overview Activity Look Ahead Authors Russia Reallocates Resources to Filtration Operations Based On Anticipated Flow of Displaced Ukrainian Civilians  In partnership with \n The Global Disinformation Lab at The University of Texas at Austin \n and written by \n Raghav Aggarwal, \n Zachary Daum, \n and Kim Nguyen  Latest Shifting filtration activity in Russia-Ukraine Impact Shifts align with anticipated civilian migration Published Nov 23 2022 1\u00a0month, 2\u00a0weeks Image Credit  Go to map  Overview  According to commercial satellite imagery and open-source reporting, Moscow dismantled tents at alleged filtration sites in the southern Donetsk Oblast region, at the Russian Veselo-Voznesenka border checkpoint, and along the M-2 Highway between the towns of Kharkiv and Belgorod in Russia likely due to the decline in displaced civilian movement (as evidenced in declining vehicle activity) and \u201cfiltration\u201d needs through these areas. In contrast, imagery of purported filtration sites at the Logachevka border checkpoint in Belgorod Oblast and the three border crossing stations in Crimea have not shown similar reductions in activity. Rather, as of September 2022, tents remained intact at Logachevka and new infrastructure expansions appeared at the Crimean checkpoints. Moscow likely focused and reallocated resources to filtration sites where they expected an increasing civilian flux from the next stages of the conflict. Activity In analyzing the Russian filtration system used currently in the Russia-Ukraine War, the Kremlin's narrative regarding the nature of the system and the processes employed on Ukrainian civilians are unsurprisingly at odds with the West. Through the analysis of commercial satellite imagery and open-source reporting on ten filtration sites, the Global Disinformation Lab (GDIL) offers evidence to counter a senior Russian official's denial of the existence of filtration sites at a United Nations Security Council Meeting. GDIL identified six new potential filtration sites at or near checkpoints into Russia or Russian-occupied Ukraine, monitored filtration activity at the six sites as well as at four filtration sites in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine that were previously identified by the Conflict Observatory, and evaluated how regional filtration activity trends related to anticipated, active, or settled conflict areas. \nIn monitoring site filtration activity, we discovered a dismantling of tents and\/or a decline in vehicular activity at four previously identified filtration sites in Donetsk Oblast and at two possible filtration sites in the Rostov and Belgorod Oblasts in Russia. In contrast, we observed a continued use of tents and a high level of vehicle activity at another possible filtration site at the Logachevka border checkpoint in Belgorod Oblast and an expansion of alleged filtration site infrastructure at three Crimean border crossings. \nIn areas of dismantled tents and\/or decreasing vehicle activity, the Kremlin likely either saw a steady decline or anticipated a reduction in civilian movement, and thus, a reduced need for filtration operations. Based on this pattern, we assess with moderate confidence that Moscow focuses and reallocates resources to filtration sites expected to have more utility in the next stages of the conflict, where they anticipate shifts in civilian flows. To make these judgments, we compared imagery of filtration sites throughout the conflict and analyzed changes in physical infrastructure (e.g., permanent buildings, tents, and roads), vehicular activity (e.g., parked vehicles, types of vehicles, and vehicle queues), human queuing, considered the site's proximity to areas of intense fighting, and reviewed open-source reporting to corroborate our claims. Article  Timeline  Graphs  The Russian Filtration System and the Mixed Messaging According to a U.S. Department of State report, \u201cRussian officials\u2026in Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine are undertaking a monumental effort to \u2018filter\u2019 the population as a means of suppressing Ukrainian resistance and enforcing loyalty among the remaining population.\u201d Within the Russian filtration system, Ukrainian civilians are first screened and documented at a filtration site, and in some instances undergo interrogation, collection of biometric data, and invasive searches. After processing, civilians face one of three outcomes depending on the threat they pose to the Russian war effort: 1) detainment and imprisonment in Eastern Ukraine or Russia, 2) forced deportation to Russia, or 3) documentation and free movement. For those who are forcibly deported to Russia, the displaced persons are held at Russian-operated temporary accommodation centers (TACs). Despite Western exposure of the human rights abuses at the filtration sites, on September 7, 2022, Vasily Nebenzya, Russian representative to the United Nations, publicly denied their existence at a U.N. Security Council Meeting and accused the West of an attempt to spread disinformation. Moscow spun positive narratives on filtration sites, referring to them instead as TACs, likely to portray the sites as having a humanitarian purpose. Monitored Activity at Alleged Filtration Sites We analyzed ten alleged filtration sites (see Figure 1 below) using commercial imagery and publicly available reporting. This analysis included four sites in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine that were initially identified by the Conflict Observatory in an online report dated August 25, 2022. To contribute to the body of analysis, GDIL conducted further monitoring of the activity at the four sites using updated imagery, provided additional illustrative data originally excluded from the Conflict Observatory report, and assessed the activity trends to evaluate the regional shifts in filtration activity. The Conflict Observatory report\u2019s filtration identification methodology aided GDIL in setting key indicators for filtration activity (e.g., location and proximity to major areas of conflict, use of tents and\/or expansion of infrastructure, vehicle queues, high volumes of parked passenger vehicles and high-capacity vehicles, and human queues). In addition, GDIL gleaned a baseline understanding of the levels of vehicle and pedestrian activity expected at a filtration site. To identify new sites, GDIL explored areas outside Donetsk that were not previously reported, searched for the key indicators in imagery, and sought to corroborate possible filtration operations with open-source reporting. As a result, GDIL identified six new potential filtration sites at or near checkpoints into Russia or Russian-occupied Ukraine, monitored the site activity over time, and evaluated how regional filtration activity trends related to anticipated, active, or settled conflict areas. The ten sites include the following locations: Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine Manhush (two sites) Nikolske Bezimenne Rostov Oblast, Russia Veselo-Voznesenka Belgorod Oblast, Russia M-2 Highway (near the Nekhoteevka checkpoint) Logachevka Crimea, Russian-occupied Ukraine Armyansk Perekop Peredmistne Figure 1 \u2013 Map of Controlled Territory and Alleged Filtration Sites with Activity Changes. Original Work by GDIL. *These are general boundaries of territorial control. For more detailed maps, visit Reuters Graphics and the Institute for the Study of War.  Graphic A \u2013 Activity at Filtration Sites, Original Work by GDIL  Declining Activity in Previously Identified Filtration Sites in the Donetsk Oblast We analyzed imagery of four sites in the southern Donetsk Oblast region (see Figure 1), which were identified and reported on by the Conflict Observatory as locations with filtration operations. GDIL\u2019s goal was not to duplicate Conflict Observatory\u2019s findings. Rather, we aimed to add to the analysis by monitoring activity at the four sites using updated imagery, providing additional data not originally included in the report, and identifying and incorporating site activity trends into GDIL\u2019s overall analysis of how the trends relate to areas of anticipated, active, or settled conflict. All four sites began demonstrating signs of declining vehicle activity or the removal of tent structures between May and July 2022, according to imagery reviewed by GDIL. The Conflict Observatory reported the dismantling of deployed tents at the site in Bezimenne, Donetsk Oblast as of June 2022; however, GDIL\u2019s analysis of imagery identified a reduction in vehicle activity at the other three sites in Manhush and Nikolske. Since these three sites were housed in permanent buildings, we analyzed vehicle activity over time to evaluate the trends in filtration site activity. Moscow likely responded to the decreased civilian traffic in the southern Donetsk region by dismantling filtration tents where they were deployed and leveling down operations in permanent buildings, reflecting their reduced need for filtration in the region. Russian state media reports corroborated this decline in civilian intake. On April 2, 2022, TASS, a Russian state-owned news agency, reported that 14,168 people and 3,300 vehicles had crossed into Russia from Ukraine in the past 24 hours. On October 6, 2022, TASS reported that refugee intake was \u201con the decline\u201d and claimed over 3,500 people had crossed in the same period. Manhush, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine\u00a0 Using testimonies and video media, the Conflict Observatory identified two filtration sites in the town of Manhush, located in the southern Donetsk Oblast region: 1) A police checkpoint and 2) the Manhush District Department of Internal Affairs (2 km east of the police checkpoint). GDIL is contributing imagery analysis of both sites to evaluate the changes in site filtration activity over time. Since both sites used permanent structures for filtration operations, we used levels of vehicle activity as a proxy for the level of filtration site activity. GDIL observed an overall decline in vehicle activity at the two locations, which started between April and May 2022 and continued into October 2022. At the police checkpoint, imagery analysis from August 30, 2021 (pre-invasion) to April 3, 2022, suggested a significant increase in vehicle activity, which likely reflected the civilian migration spurred by the fighting in the nearby city of Mariupol in the spring of 2022. In August 2021, there was little traffic passing through the checkpoint (see Figure 2). In April 2022, we identified approximately 20 white vans parked inside the checkpoint and 76 vehicles queued at the checkpoint headed west (see Figure 3). Between April 3 and May 8, 2022, we first noticed a decline in vehicles, with approximately 13 parked vans inside the checkpoint and 27 vehicles headed in both directions on May 8, 2022 (see Figure 4). In addition, the extensive vehicle queue, observed in April 2022 heading toward Ukraine, was not present. Between May 8 and October 12, 2022, we observed a further reduction in vehicle traffic, with the absence of the vans and the vehicle queue and only some commercial vehicles heading in both directions on October 12, 2022 (see Figure 5). Similarly, in our review of the imagery capturing the Manhush District Department of Internal Affairs filtration site, we observed an increase in vehicle activity between August 30, 2021 (pre-invasion) and April 3, 2022. In August 2021, there was little traffic in the areas around the site (see Figure 2). In April 2022, we identified approximately 150 vehicles near the site (see Figure 3). Between April 3 and May 8, 2022, the vehicle activity at the site began to decline with approximately 37 vehicles in the same site vicinity on May 8, 2022 (see Figure 4). Between May 8 and October 12, 2022, we saw a relative increase in the number of vehicles parked in the lot on the east side of the filtration area on October 12, 2022 (see Figure 5). However, there was an overall decline in vehicle activity between April 3 and October 12, 2022, with an estimated 72 vehicles present in the same areas on October 12, 2022, a 50% reduction in vehicle activity since April 2022. The reduced vehicular traffic at the two Manhush sites is part of an assessed downward trend in civilian movement through the filtration process in the southern Donetsk Oblast region. This downward trend appeared to start when the battle in nearby Mariupol was drawing to a close in May 2022 and the Kremlin secured control of the region (see Graphic A and Figure 1). Figure 2 \u2013 Imagery from August 30, 2021 (pre-invasion) showed little to no traffic at both Manhush filtration sites: 1) the Police Checkpoint (top) and 2) the Manhush District Department of Internal Affairs Building (bottom).

Copyright Maxar 2022  Nikolske, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine The Conflict Observatory used open sources and imagery analysis to identify the Nikolske Police Department as a filtration site. In their report, they provided imagery from March 19 and April 3, 2022, to demonstrate the increasing volume of vehicle activity at the site between the two months. GDIL estimated vehicle counts from the April 3, 2022 imagery, which were not included in the earlier Conflict Observatory reporting, analyzed new imagery from July 31 and November 15, 2022, and assessed an overall declining trend in vehicle traffic between April and July 2022. We estimated approximately 54 passenger vehicles and seven white buses in the areas around the Police Department on April 3, 2022. According to imagery acquired by GDIL, this was followed by decreases in traffic on July 31, 2022 (see Figure 6) and November 15, 2022, with approximately 25 vehicles and two buses in the same areas (see Figure 7). Similar to that experienced by the neighboring town of Manhush, the end to the fighting in Mariupol in May 2022 likely slowed the migration of civilians fleeing battle zones through filtration sites in southern Donetsk such as the one in Nikolske (see Graphic A). Figure 6 \u2013 Imagery from July 31, 2022 (approximately five months post-invasion) showed low vehicle activity around the Nikolske Police Station compared to the high volumes observed by the Conflict Observatory on April 3, 2022. Copyright Maxar 2022  Figure 7 \u2013 Imagery from November 15, 2022 (approximately nine months post-invasion) showed low vehicle activity around the Nikolske Police Station as similarly observed on July 31, 2022. Copyright Maxar 2022  Bezimenne, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine The Conflict Observatory report used civilian testimonies and imagery to identify the filtration operation at a location in Bezimenne. They also revealed the decline in vehicle activity at the Bezimenne filtration site between March and June 2022 and the dismantling of the 30 site tents as of June 2022. According to GDIL\u2019s analysis of imagery dated October 3, 2022 (see Figure 8), we observed the continued absence of tents and vehicle traffic at the site. Of the four sites in the Donetsk Oblast included in this assessment, Bezimenne is the only site that relied on temporary infrastructure to conduct filtration operations. At the sites in Manhush and Nikolske, which were housed under permanent structures, we monitored changes in filtration activity using vehicle activity as a proxy indicator. The significance of including the Conflict Observatory\u2019s findings on the vehicle activity levels and use and subsequent dismantlement of the Bezimenne tents are two-fold: 1) it was a strong visual indication of Moscow\u2019s lack of need for the filtration site which added support to our assessment of the decreasing civilian migration and filtration activity in the southern Donetsk region and 2) it led GDIL to use tent deployment and dismantlement and levels of vehicle activity as signatures of filtration operations in our search for new unreported sites along the Ukraine-Russia border. Figure 8 \u2013 Imagery from October 3, 2022 (approximately eight months post-invasion) continued to show an empty lot and no vehicle queue where the filtration encampment was once located on March 22, 2022. Copyright Planet Labs PBC 2022  Activity Variations at Possible Filtration Sites along the Ukraine-Russia Border We extended our analysis into areas outside of the Donetsk Oblast region. Using our baseline of key signatures for filtration operations, we identified three new, unreported possible sites at or near Russian checkpoints along the Ukraine-Russia Border in the Rostov and Belgorod Oblasts (see Figure 1). GDIL observed the deployment of tents and\/or vehicle traffic in imagery from April to May 2022 at the three locations, which are characteristic of filtration operations. At two of the alleged filtration sites (Veselo-Voznesenka checkpoint in Rostov Oblast and the M-2 Highway site in Belgorod Oblast), the removal of tents and decreasing vehicular traffic from May 2022 to August 2022 may have illustrated a decline in displaced civilian movement through these areas by August 2022 and Moscow\u2019s decision to reallocate filtration resources to other areas. In contrast, imagery of the Logachevka site in Belgorod Oblast from April to September 2022 suggested that the Russians did not reduce their filtration operations at the checkpoint in the same time period. Veselo-Voznesenka, Rostov Oblast, Russia\u00a0 Our analysis of imagery located a possible filtration site at the Russian Veselo-Voznesenka checkpoint, located 26 km east of Bezimenne off a major highway. We identified filtration site indicators such as tent encampments and vehicle queues. Between March 14, 2021 (pre-invasion) and April 6, 2022, imagery analysis suggested the installation of approximately 20 tents near the right of the checkpoint by April 6, 2022 (see Figure 10) and a large queue of approximately 100 vehicles transiting from Ukraine into Russia. We are uncertain of the type of filtration activity at the checkpoint. Western news media referred to the Veselo-Voznesenka checkpoint as a \u201ctransit point\u201d; however, given that the checkpoint is the closest crossing into Russia for civilians leaving the town of Mariupol in the southern Donetsk Oblast region, we assess with moderate confidence that Russian authorities registered and screened Ukrainians prior to entry into Russia. Analysis of imagery between April 6, 2022, and July 18, 2022, the site downsized from 20 to 15 tents, and the vehicle queue decreased from approximately 100 to 44 vehicles entering Russia. In Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from August 2022, the tent footprint was non-existent, suggesting that authorities dismantled the tents between August 6 and 16, 2022 (see Figure 11). Due to the poor resolution of the August 2022 images, we were not able to conduct a comparative analysis of the vehicular traffic at the site from July to August 2022. Sentinel 2-A satellite imagery dated November 14, 2022, confirmed the continued absence of the tents at the site; however, due to the low resolution, we were not able to review the site vehicle activity. The removal of the tent cluster as seen in Figure 11 and the downward trend in vehicle activity at the site were consistent with the trends seen at the Manhush, Nikolske, and Bezimenne filtration sites, which are all located in the southern Donetsk Oblast region and within 92 km west of the Veselo-Voznesenka checkpoint. We assess with moderate confidence that the end to the fighting in Mariupol in May 2022 led to the decrease in civilian movement through the checkpoint, and Russian authorities no longer saw the need for the filtration tents. Figure 9 \u2013 Imagery from March 14, 2021 (pre-invasion) showed little to no activity in all areas of the Veselo-Voznesenka checkpoint. Google Earth Pro 2022  Figure 10 \u2013 Imagery from April 6, 2022 (approximately 1 month post-invasion) showed a new tent encampment and heightened vehicle activity around the Veselo-Voznesenka checkpoint. Copyright Maxar 2022  Figure 11 \u2013 Imagery from August 6 and 16, 2022 (approximately five to six months post-invasion) showed the tent dismantlement at the Veselo-Voznesenka checkpoint, with the encampment present on August 6, 2022, but absent on August 16, 2022. Sentinel 2-A 2022  M-2 Highway, Belgorod Oblast, Russia Through imagery and open media analysis, we located a possible filtration site along the M-2 Highway in the Belgorod Oblast, between the Ukrainian town of Kharkiv and the Russian town of Belgorod. Imagery analysis included tent encampments and vehicle activity similar to what was observed at the identified filtration camps in the Donetsk Oblast. In July 2022, a Russian official reported the relocation of a mobile \u201cTAC\u201d\u00a0 to a spot 8 km from the Nekhoteevka checkpoint on the Ukraine-Russia border in Belgorod Oblast, Russia. The alleged M-2 Highway filtration site is located generally in that vicinity, approximately 12 km from Nekhoteevka. Between April 26, 2019 (pre-invasion) and May 20, 2022, imagery analysis suggested a deployment of tents by May 2022 (see Figures 12 and 13). Although the Russian official referred to the site as a TAC, filtration was probably performed at this location because it would be the first tent encampment encountered on a major highway leading out of the city of Kharkiv, which saw intense fighting up until May 2022. The situation is comparable to the Manhush, Bezimenne, and the Veselo-Voznesenka filtration sites, which are also located on major highways leading out of intense fighting in Mariupol. Furthermore, open-source reporting mentioned the existence of a filtration site between Kharkiv and Belgorod where civilians endured \u201cfingerprinting\u2026 and an interrogation with a \u2018psychologist\u2019.\u201d Due to the identification of several key filtration site indicators and corroborating open-source reporting, we assess with high confidence that the M-2 Highway location was a filtration site. According to GDIL imagery analysis, the number of tents and parked vehicles more than doubled from May 20, 2022, to July 6, 2022. In that time frame, the number of tents increased from four to nine, and the number of parked vehicles from approximately 13 to 36 (see Figures 13 and 14). In July 2022, we also observed a white bus at the driveway into the tent encampment (see Figure 14). Although we observed increases in vehicle activity, the overall numbers are relatively low compared to the vehicle traffic observed at filtration sites in southern Donetsk and at the Veselo-Voznesenka checkpoint. These sites experienced numbers ranging from approximately 60 to 150 queued and parked vehicles and high-capacity vehicles at peak activity, compared to the M-2 Highway site\u2019s peak volume of approximately 37 vehicles on July 6, 2022. Between July 30 and August 9, 2022, authorities dismantled the northern collection of tents according to imagery from the Sentinel-2A satellite (see Figure 15). In that same period, a Russian regional official described a \u201cslight decrease [of those staying from Ukraine]\u201d at the site and stated that they would remove the mobile site once it was \u201cno longer needed.\u201d The Kremlin likely anticipated a flux of displaced civilians from the fighting in Kharkiv between February and May 2022 and deployed the filtration site to process Ukrainians (see Graphic A), but dismantled the site due to a reduction in civilian traffic or an underwhelming turnout at the site in late Summer 2022. Despite the continued Ukrainian counteroffensives between September and October 2022 in the Kharkiv Oblast region, commercial imagery analysis between August 9 and October 12, 2022, suggested that the Russians did not reconstruct the alleged filtration tents or \u201cmobile TACs\u201d at the location, which would have been well positioned to process Ukrainian civilians fleeing the resurging conflict. As of October 12, 2022, only two temporary structures adjacent to the gas station were still present (see Figure 16). We assess that the Ukrainian advancement north of the city of Kharkiv in September 2022 likely slowed an already low civilian migration to Belgorod, Russia. When the area north of Kharkiv was under Russian control in early September, the Russian authorities likely urged civilians to flee to Russia. As Ukraine retook territory in Kharkiv, this likely eliminated Russian authorities\u2019 influence on civilian migration to Belgorod. Thus, the Kremlin likely did not expect significant civilian flows to Belgorod through the M-2 Highway site; and therefore, did not reconstitute the filtration infrastructure at the location. Figure 12 \u2013 Imagery from April 26, 2019 (pre-invasion) showed minimal activity at the alleged filtration site on the M-2 Highway.

Copyright Maxar 2022  Logachevka, Belgorod Oblast, Russia The Logachevka border crossing checkpoint, located between Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine, and Belgorod Oblast, Russia, is a possible site where Moscow is using tent deployments combined with existing infrastructure to conduct filtration operations. Between August 6, 2020 (pre-invasion) and September 9, 2022, imagery analysis of the Logachevka site suggested the presence of three key indicators for filtration operations: 1) the deployment of tents at the checkpoint, 2) extensive vehicle queues, and 3) human queuing at tent structures. On April 9, 2022, we first observed the tent deployment at the checkpoint and a 3.1 km long passenger vehicle queue attempting to enter Russia (see Figure 18). On July 8, 2022, although the extensive vehicle queue primarily consisted of commercial trucks, we identified a potential area of human queuing at the blue tent (see Figure 19). On September 9, 2022, we measured a vehicle queue approximately 2.5 km in length and continued to observe the presence of the tent cluster (see Figure 20). We cropped the images in Figures 18 through 20 to fit them in the report; therefore, the entire vehicle queues were not included. We lacked open-source reporting to directly support our assessment of filtration activities at the Logachevka checkpoint, but there had been general statements by Ukrainian media of Russian soldiers interrogating Ukrainians in Belgorod. Based on the three identified key indicators for filtration activity at the site, paired with limited open-source reporting, we assess with low to medium confidence that the Logachevka checkpoint was used for filtration. Imagery analysis from April to September 2022 of the Logachevka site suggested that the Russians have sustained filtration operations at the checkpoint, with the continued presence of tents at the site until the most recently available and discernable imagery on September 9, 2022 (see Figure 20). We reviewed site imagery from November 15, 2022; however, the poor quality of the image precluded further evaluations of the site. Long passenger vehicle queues observed in April 2022 did not reappear until September 2022 with long vehicle queues primarily comprised of commercial trucks. Furthermore, between May 1, 2022, and June 30, 2022, there was an absence of vehicle queues crossing through the checkpoint. Based on these findings, GDIL assesses that the Logachevka checkpoint experienced waves of civilian migration triggered by the fighting in Kharkiv Oblast between February and May 2022 and then in early September, when the Ukrainians launched their counteroffensive on September 6, 2022 (see Graphic A). In between those times, the commercial transport of goods between Russian-controlled territories and Russia appeared to dominate travel through the Logachevka checkpoint. In addition, due to the checkpoint\u2019s location and proximity to the estimated boundary of claimed control by Ukraine and Russia (see Figure 1), we assess with moderate confidence that Moscow anticipates a continued flow of displaced civilians into Russia through the checkpoint with the possibility that Ukraine may seek additional territorial gains in the area. We assess that the difference in activity between the two sites located near or at Russian checkpoints is related to the Ukrainian counteroffensives between September and October 2022 and the assessed territorial control in the region. In contrast to the M-2 Highway site, we observed consistent long vehicle queues (passenger and\/or commercial) and the continued use of deployed tents between April and September 2022 at Logachevka. In this same time period, the territory that would feed displaced populations through the Logachevka checkpoint had remained in Russian control. In these Russian-controlled regions, authorities likely transited willing and unwilling civilians into Russia, not into Ukraine, and sustained the use of the site filtration tents due to an expected reliable flow of civilians through the site. Figure 17 \u2013 Imagery from August 6, 2020 (pre-invasion) showed little to no activity at the Logachevka border checkpoint. Google Earth Pro 2022  Figure 18 \u2013 Imagery from April 9, 2022 (approximately 2 months post-invasion) showed new tent deployments and a 3.1 km queue of vehicles entering from Ukraine through the Logachevka checkpoint, indicating a significant increase in Ukrainian civilian intake compared to the pre-invasion situation.

The tents were also still present. Copyright Maxar 2022  Expansion of Possible Filtration Sites at Crimean Border Checkpoints We continued our pursuit to identify additional unreported filtration sites in other Russian-controlled territories. Through our analysis of available imagery and corroborating open-source reports, we identified three new possible filtration sites at the Armyansk, Perekop, and Peredmistne border crossing checkpoints between Ukraine and Crimea. Through imagery analysis from April to September 2022, we observed key visual indicators of filtration sites at the checkpoints, including expanding infrastructure at all three crossings. A lack of tent deployments at the locations as well as the absence of key filtration site indicators within 50 km of these three checkpoints, suggested that the filtration operations occurred under the permanent structures as civilians passed through in their vehicles or by foot. As illustrated in open-source interviews with Ukrainians fleeing into Crimea, one man stated that the Russian authorities confiscated his cell phone at a Crimean checkpoint to review his contacts and social media accounts and purportedly downloaded his data. Separately, in an interview with a Ukrainian human rights organization that collected multiple civilian testimonies, the interviewee pointed to the Crimean border crossing at Armyansk as a filtration site. Based on the imagery analysis, publicly available reporting, and proximity to the Ukrainian southern counteroffensive, we assess with moderate confidence that there were filtration operations at the three checkpoints into Crimea. The Russians may have expanded their filtration operations with the construction of new permanent structures in September 2022 due to the anticipated fighting in Kherson Oblast, where the Ukrainians launched a southern counteroffensive in August 2022 and continued to advance as of early November 2022 towards the Russian-controlled city of Kherson (see Graphic A). At the time, Russian authorities likely anticipated an influx of displaced civilians and an increasing need for filtration operations at the Crimean checkpoints due to the fighting. Armyansk, Russian-Occupied Crimea As previously discussed, we identified the Armyansk border checkpoint, located on the Crimean Peninsula between Kherson Oblast and Crimea, as a site with possible filtration activity. Between May 5, 2021 (pre-invasion) and May 29, 2022, imagery analysis revealed an increase in activity from little to no visible vehicle or human queues at the Armyansk checkpoint before the war to a queue of approximately 52 passenger vehicles and possible human crowds waiting to enter Crimea a year later (see Figures 21 and 22). Analyzing imagery between May 29 and September 26, 2022, we identified the reconstruction and relocation of a new service road bypassing the checkpoint on both sides of the border, which made way for a new permanent structure, and a high volume of pedestrians queuing at a small, green-roofed station before the crossing into Crimea (see Figures 22 and 23). Due to the identification of several key filtration site indicators, including proximity to the Ukrainian southern counteroffensive, vehicle and pedestrian queues, and the use and expansion of infrastructure, as well as corroborating open-source reports directly naming Armyansk as a filtration site, we assess with moderate to high confidence that there were filtration operations at this location. Imagery analysis between April 29, 2022 and September 26, 2022 showed queues that ranged from 23 to 120 passenger vehicles, averaging approximately 62 passenger vehicles awaiting entry into Crimea. With the Ukrainian southern counteroffensive approaching the town of Kherson in late August 2022, we assess with moderate confidence that Russian authorities constructed the new permanent structure, as opposed to deploying tents, to accommodate the existing and expected high volumes of queued vehicles and the long wait times due to the filtration operations. We also assess that the expanded service road was likely constructed for civilians or military personnel with the appropriate credentials and\/or documentation to bypass the filtration activities occurring under the permanent structures. As anticipated, between September 26 and October 20, 2022, we observed an increase in the number of vehicles in queue from approximately 23 to 61 passenger vehicles awaiting entry through the checkpoint. This increasing activity likely aligned with the urgency to move civilians out of Kherson due to the tense military situation and the advancement of Ukrainian forces in late October 2022. Between October 20 and 29, 2022, we noticed a substantial shift in the vehicle queues, with vehicles lining up to re-enter Ukraine and a few vehicles, primarily commercial trucks, awaiting to enter Crimea. Figure 21 \u2013 Imagery from May 5, 2021 (pre-invasion) showed minimal activity at the Armyansk border checkpoint between Ukraine and Russian-occupied Crimea. Google Earth Pro 2022  Figure 22 \u2013 Imagery from May 29, 2022 (approximately three months post-invasion) showed a significant increase in vehicle and civilian foot traffic coming from Ukraine, as well as a new service road bypassing the Armyansk checkpoint.

Copyright Maxar 2022  Perekop, Russian-Occupied Crimea As previously discussed and similar to the Armyansk location, we identified the Perekop border checkpoint, located on the Crimean Peninsula between Kherson Oblast and Crimea, as a site with possible filtration activity. Between May 5, 2021 (pre-invasion) and May 25, 2022, imagery analysis revealed an increase in activity from little to no visible vehicle or human queues at the Perekop checkpoint before the war to a queue of approximately 40 passenger vehicles (see Figure 24). Compared to the Armyansk checkpoint, we observed similar construction of new permanent infrastructure and vehicular queues at the Perekop border crossing in the same time frame. Between August 29 and September 6, 2022, analysis of Sentinel 2-A imagery showed the construction of a new processing station similar to the one observed at Armyansk (see Figure 25). Due to the identification of several key filtration site indicators, including proximity to the Ukrainian southern counteroffensive in Kherson Oblast, the presence of extensive vehicle queues, and the expansion of infrastructure, as well as a corroborating open-source report describing filtration activities at Crimean checkpoints, we assess with moderate confidence that there were filtration operations at this location. Post-invasion analysis of imagery from April 29, 2022, to July 21, 2022, showed a range of 20 to 40 queued vehicles, averaging approximately 33 passenger vehicles, waiting to cross the border. With the Ukrainian southern counteroffensive approaching the town of Kherson in late August 2022, we assess with moderate confidence that Russian authorities constructed the new permanent structure, as opposed to using tents, to accommodate the existing and anticipated high volumes of queued vehicles and the long wait times due to the filtration operations. As anticipated, analysis of imagery from September 25, October 22, and November 5, 2022, showed a steady increase from approximately 18 to 23 to 66 queued vehicles, respectively, waiting to enter through the Perekop checkpoint (see Figures 26 and 27). Similar to Armyansk, the increase in vehicle activity at the Perekop border checkpoint was likely due to the Russian authorities urging civilians to flee Kherson in late October 2022. Figure 24 \u2013 Imagery from May 5, 2021 (pre-invasion) showed minimal activity at the Perekop border checkpoint between Ukraine and Russian-occupied Crimea.

Copyright Maxar 2022  Peredmistne, Russian-Occupied Crimea As previously discussed and similar to the situation at the Armyansk and Perekop locations, we identified the Peredmistne border checkpoint, located on the Crimean Peninsula between Kherson Oblast and Crimea, as a site with possible filtration activity. We had limited access to clear, post-invasion imagery of the border crossing with only one clear image from October 2022 and a few low-resolution images from the Sentinel 2-A satellite between June 5 and August 29, 2022. In our analysis of the low-resolution Sentinel 2-A imagery from between June 5 and August 29, 2022, we identified the expansion of the service roads to the west of the checkpoint which allowed space for the construction of a new processing station between August 9 and 29, 2022 (see Figure 28). We evaluated the vehicle activity at the site to determine if any vehicle queues were associated with the migration of displaced persons. Although we observed approximately two dozen vehicles queued to enter Crimea on October 8, 2022, pre-invasion imagery from 2019 and 2021 showed similar, if not longer vehicle queues. For example, pre-invasion site imagery from June 26, 2019, revealed a significant vehicle queue waiting to enter Crimea (see Figure 29); therefore, we could not assess whether the vehicles queuing at the checkpoint on October 8, 2022, were attributed to fleeing civilians or reflected typical vehicle movement through the checkpoint. At Peredmistne, we identified only one key filtration site indicator \u2013 the use and expansion of infrastructure (see Figure 30 for a clear image of the new permanent structure and the service roads as of October 8, 2022). The location of the checkpoint is located further from the Ukrainian counteroffensives in Kherson, approximately 264 km, as compared to its counterparts at Armyansk and Perekop, which measure about 130 km from Kherson. We used an open-source report that described filtration activities at Crimean checkpoints, but it did not specify at which location. With this limited body of evidence, in combination with the consideration that the Peredmistne border checkpoint experienced infrastructure expansions and timelines that paralleled those at the other two Crimean checkpoints, we assess with low to medium confidence that there were filtration operations at this location. We also assess with low to moderate confidence that Russian authorities constructed the new permanent structure due to an anticipated increase in civilian migration from the conflict in Kherson Oblast, Ukraine, similar to the situations at Armyansk and Perekop. Due to the limited amount of imagery and the lack of a pre-war baseline to evaluate conflict-induced civilian migration, we were not able to confirm if the site experienced increased civilian movement after the expansion, and thus, if the Russians properly judged the need for the checkpoint expansion. Figure 28 \u2013 Imagery from June 5, August 9, and August 29, 2022 (approximately three to six months post-invasion) showed the expansion of the service roads between June 5 and August 9, 2022, and the construction of the permanent structure at the Peredmistne border checkpoint, with the feature absent on August 9, 2022, but present on August 29, 2022.

It reveals evidence to suggest that long-term prisons have become a greater priority than reeducation centers, along with those located in rural areas or in areas administered by the XPCC, among other trends. Overall, this report helps chart the current trajectory of China\u2019s widespread detention of Uyghur and ethnic minority populations in the region. About This Series: A growing body of research has systematically documented China\u2019s efforts to imprison, detain, and re-educate ethnic Uyghur and minority groups throughout its western Xinjiang province. In this three-part investigation, RAND researchers explore new data on nighttime lighting in Xinjiang to offer new, empirical insights into China\u2019s efforts to reeducate, detain, and imprison its Uyghur and ethnic minority populations across Xinjiang.  Activity GEOINT analysis of nighttime lighting data over known detention and reeducation facilities in Xinjiang reveal key trends in the growth and decline of facilities based upon their purpose, location, proximity to key infrastructure, and camp characteristics.  Article  Timeline  Graphs  In the first report in this series, RAND introduced its approach to empirically assess the rapid, coordinated growth of Uyghur and ethnic minority detention facilities across Xinjiang using nighttime lighting. Our analysis revealed a clear inflection point beginning in 2016, after which the pace of growth in Xinjiang's detention system accelerated rapidly, and continued unfettered for roughly thirty-six months to follow. In our second report, RAND employed a new approach based upon these nighttime lighting data to systematically assess the operating status of known detention facilities. This analysis revealed that\u00a0only\u00a0three percent of known detention facilities in Xinjiang show clear evidence consistent with likely closure, despite official Chinese government claims to the contrary. Instead, nearly half of all Uyghur and ethnic minority detention facilities analyzed across Xinjiang exhibited uninterrupted growth in nighttime lighting since their construction. This final report dives even deeper into the Xinjiang detention system, exploring the broader trends in growth and decline of facilities across Xinjiang based upon their known characteristics such as its type, location, proximity to residential areas and other facilities, and visible security features. It reveals new insights into the types of facilities, and geographic locations, where growth in nighttime lighting has continued through 2020. This research aims to help future researchers chart the trajectory of China's widespread detention of Uyghur and ethnic minority populations in the region going forward, in part, by understanding where it is headed today. Background and Methodology To assess broader trends in the growth of China's detention system in Xinjiang, we return to our nighttime-lighting-based assessment of the current operating status of detention facilities in Xinjiang, as presented in the first two reports in this series. Overall, our approach calculates monthly nighttime lighting data over known detention facilities in Xinjiang, based on a dataset of 380 known or suspected facilities originally identified and geolocated by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI). Using the locations of these facilities, we measure the average nighttime lighting over each facility on a monthly basis from 2014 through mid-2020 and identify major periods of uninterrupted growth or decline in nighttime lighting over time. Further details on this methodology are provided in our first report. Based upon these nighttime lighting data, we then identify a set of four common growth trajectories that appear consistently across nearly all of the 380 detention facilities in our dataset. These growth trajectories include those detention facilities with sustained growth in nighttime lighting over our entire time period, those with stable or cyclical nighttime lighting over time, those with major growth followed by a partial decline, and finally, those with major growth followed by a near-complete decline in nighttime lighting. Further details on this methodology are provided in our second report. Overall, we classify each of the known detention facilities in Xinjiang into one of these four growth trajectories, as summarized below in Table One. This table also provides a visual example of the nighttime lighting trajectory commonly seen in each category. Table One. Nighttime Lighting Growth Trajectories of Xinjiang Detention Facilities, 2014-2020 Note: Nighttime lighting estimates are shown from an example facility drawn from each category, plotting both normalized (in blue) and ten month double moving average (in red) nighttime lighting for each month from January 2014 through May 2020. Source: Authors' estimates based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  Our previous report focused primarily on those facilities in the fourth growth profile, which experienced major growth in nighttime lighting followed by a significant decline to levels at or near pre-construction nighttime lighting. Using overhead satellite imagery, we then individually assessed the operating status of each facility, determining that only 11 of these facilities showed evidence of likely closure. While many of the remaining 40 facilities in this category showed clear evidence in satellite imagery that they remained open, others proved inconclusive. Beyond the nighttime lighting data on the 380 facilities in our dataset, we also possess data on various characteristics of each facility. This includes the type of facility (e.g. reeducation center versus detention center or prison), as well as its location, proximity to residential areas and other detention facilities, as well as the presence of visible security features such as interior fencing, external walls, or watchtowers. The vast majority of these data were gathered by ASPI in its original investigation of these facilities. Using these data, this final report seeks to explain variation in nighttime lighting across these known characteristics, in order to better understand which detention facilities are likely to expand or decline over time going forward. It focuses on the relationship between these characteristics and the four broad growth profiles identified using nighttime lighting data in our prior report, as general indicators of the growth or decline in activity at detention facilities writ large. For each covariate describing potential differences in nighttime lighting across detention facilities in our dataset, this report explores two broad questions: 1. First, are certain types of detention facilities more likely to experience sustained growth, stable, partial decline, or major declines in nighttime lighting? 2. Second, have certain types of detention facilities experienced major growth or decline at different points over time, particularly in recent years?\u00a0 Type of Facility We begin by assessing whether the nighttime lighting signature of detention facilities in Xinjiang differs based upon the type of each facility. Recall that ASPI categorizes each detention facility in our dataset into four distinct tiers, based upon their imagery signature and visible level of security. Of note, we adjust these tiers to account for our alternative assessment of the imagery signature of administrative detention centers relative to long-term prisons (described in further detail in our first report). As such, we classify the various facilities in our dataset as either low-security reeducation centers (Tier One), high-security reeducation centers (Tier Two), long-term prisons (Tier Three), and administrative detention centers (Tier Four). Figure One below plots the distribution of our four nighttime lighting growth trajectories based upon the type of each detention facility in our dataset. Those facilities with uninterrupted growth in nighttime lighting are shown in blue. Facilities with stable or cyclical nighttime lighting are shown in green. Those with a partial decline in nighttime lighting are shown in yellow, and facilities with major declines (indicating possible closure) are shown in red. Figure One. Nighttime Lighting Growth Trajectories of Xinjiang Detention Facilities, 2014-2020, by Type of Facility Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  Overall, this analysis reveals interesting differences between the growth patterns of lower-security reeducation centers as compared to higher-security prisons and administrative detention centers. On average, reeducation facilities more frequently showed partial or major declines in nighttime lighting over time. Conversely, long-term prisons and administrative detention centers have shown much more frequent growth in nighttime lighting writ large, at least over the course of the time period we analyze this research (2014 to mid-2020). Figure Two below takes a different approach to understand these trends. Rather than focus on the general growth trajectory of each type of facility over the entire dataset, it focuses instead on when these facilities experienced major growth or decline over time. Figure Two plots the percentage of all facilities by type experiencing a major period of growth (positive values) or decline (negative values) in nighttime lighting, for each month since January 2014. Figure Two. Xinjiang Detention Facilities Experiencing Major Growth or Decline in Nighttime Lighting, by Type of Facility Note: The top panel represents the percentage of all facilities of a given type, in a given month, experiencing an uninterrupted period of growth in smoothed nighttime lighting for at least six months. The bottom panel represents the same, except for facilities experiencing uninterrupted periods of declining nighttime lighting. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  Several trends emerge in this figure. First, it appears that low-security reeducation centers (Tier One) experienced slightly lower levels of major growth in nighttime lighting between 2016 and 2018 compared to other types of facilities. This is somewhat surprising, given that our prior research (in the first report of this series) suggested that the majority of construction across Xinjiang occurred over this time period. However, reduced growth in nighttime lighting could suggest that low-security reeducation centers facilities were more likely to be repurposed from existing infrastructure, or that they took less time to construct relative to more secure facilities. These results also suggest that\u00a0long-term prisons (Tier Three) have become a\u00a0primary point of emphasis in recent years, with a comparably high percentage of such facilities showing active growth in nighttime lighting in 2019 and 2020 compared to other types of facilities. This suggests that imprisonment of Uyghur and ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang has taken a greater priority than reeducation in recent years. Region To get a better sense of the geographic distribution of detention facilities experiencing growth and decline in nighttime lighting, we next compare the growth profiles of detention facilities in northern Xinjiang relative to those in southern Xinjiang. Historically, northern Xinjiang has been home to a larger percentage of Han Chinese than the south, many of whom have deliberately resettled into Xinjiang with support from the Chinese government. Moreover, northern prefectures in Xinjiang have a higher population of Mongol, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz minorities in addition to ethnic Uyghurs. Conversely, southern Xinjiang has been the historical heartland of Xinjiang's Uyghur population. Differences between the two regions could suggest a greater emphasis on detaining certain minority groups over others, or shifts in local preferences to manage large-scale detention facilities. Figure Three below plots the distribution of our four common nighttime lighting growth trajectories between northern and southern Xinjiang, divided based upon prefecture as described in the note to this figure. Overall, fewer facilities in southern Xinjiang experienced uninterrupted growth in nighttime lighting over time compared to the north, and more southern Xinjiang detention facilities experienced partial declines in nighttime lighting. But overall, these differences appear relatively marginal at first glance. Figure Three. Nighttime Lighting Growth Trajectories of Xinjiang Detention Facilities, by Region Note: Northern Xinjiang includes the following prefectures, prefecture-level cities, or cities administered by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps with known detention facilities: Altay, Beitun, Bortala, Ili, Karamay, Qumul, Sanji, Shihezi, Shuanghe, Tarbaghatay, Turpan, Urumqi, and Wujiaqu. Southern Xinjiang includes the following: Aksu, Aral, Bayingolun, Hotan, Kashgar, Kizilsu, Tiemenguan, and Tumshuq. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  To get a sense of the timing of growth in detention facilities in each region, Figure Four below plots the frequency of detention facilities experiencing major periods of growth (positive values) or decline (negative values) in nighttime lighting over time across northern and southern Xinjiang. This analysis reveals greater differences between the two regions. Overall, it appears that detention facilities in southern Xinjiang were not just more likely to experience uninterrupted growth in nighttime lighting over time, but they also started to expand much earlier, and at a faster rate than facilities in northern Xinjiang. Since 2018, however, the growth profiles of detention facilities in both regions appear to behave similarly. Figure Four.

Southern Xinjiang includes the following: Aksu, Aral, Bayingolun, Hotan, Kashgar, Kizilsu, Tiemenguan, and Tumshuq. The top panel plots the percentage of all facilities in a given region, in a given month, experiencing an uninterrupted period of growth in smoothed nighttime lighting for at least six months. The bottom panel plots the same, except for facilities experiencing uninterrupted periods of declining nighttime lighting. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  Major Prefectures Acknowledging these regional differences, we next focus on whether any specific prefectures in Xinjiang experienced more frequent growth or decline in nighttime lighting than others. We focus this analysis on just six prefectures, each with more than 25 separate detention facilities, but that collectively account for roughly two-thirds of all detention facilities in Xinjiang. Figure Five below shows the location of these facilities across these prefectures. The heaviest concentration of detention facilities in Xinjiang, by far, is in the Uyghur heartland of Kashgar and Hotan, with 72 and 52 facilities each, respectively. To the north along the Kyrgyzstan border, Aksu Prefecture holds an additional 32 detention facilities. Even further north, along the Kazakhstan border, Ili Prefecture has an additional 46 facilities. To the southeast, Bayingolun Prefecture occupies much of the center of Xinjiang, as well as its land borders with neighboring Qinghai province and the Tibet Autonomous region. It houses an additional 27 known detention facilities. Finally, the prefecture-level capital city of Xinjiang, Urumqi, has an additional 25 facilities within its borders as well. Figure Five. Prefectures in Xinjiang with 25 or More Detention Facilities Source: Data from Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020. Administrative boundaries from GADM.  While these six prefectures represent the vast majority of Xinjiang's broader detention system, their respective detention facilities show largely different nighttime lighting signatures over time. Below, in Figure Six, we show the distribution of nighttime lighting growth trajectories within each prefecture. Figure Six. Nighttime Lighting Growth Trajectories of Xinjiang Detention Facilities, by Prefecture Note: Only prefectures with 25 or more detention facilities are shown, accounting for roughly two-thirds of all detention facilities in Xinjiang. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  Detention facilities in Kashgar, Hotan, and Aksu prefectures exhibit relatively comparable nighttime lighting growth trajectories, with detention facilities in Aksu showing slightly elevated levels of uninterrupted nighttime lighting growth. Northwestern Ili Prefecture stands out from the pack, with a significantly greater incidence of detention facilities with major declines in nighttime lighting. Conversely, detention facilities in the capital city of Urumqi showed incredibly stable nighttime lighting signatures over time, with a drastically lower incidence of detention facilities with declining levels of activity compared to other prefectures. Figure Seven explores the timing of growth and decline in nighttime lighting across detention facilities in these prefectures. As shown below, this figure plots the frequency of detention facilities in each of these prefectures experiencing major periods of growth (positive values) or decline (negative values) in nighttime lighting over time. Most prefectures appear to have followed a similar growth trajectory over time, with two major exceptions. Specifically, nighttime lighting growth at detention facilities in Ili Prefecture and in Urumqi occurred much more slowly than elsewhere through much of Xinjiang's expansionary period from 2016-2017. Figure Seven. Xinjiang Detention Facilities Experiencing Major Growth or Decline in Nighttime Lighting, by Prefecture Note: The top panel plots the percentage of all facilities of a given prefecture, in a given month, experiencing an uninterrupted period of growth in smoothed nighttime lighting for at least six months. The bottom panel plots the same, except for facilities experiencing uninterrupted periods of declining nighttime lighting. Only prefectures with 25 or more detention facilities are shown, accounting for roughly two-thirds of all detention facilities in Xinjiang. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  But by early 2018, nighttime lighting in Ili would rise rapidly to levels comparable to other prefectures, and fall drastically through the beginning of 2019. In Urumqi, however, nighttime lighting growth would remain relatively infrequent throughout much of 2018, but then continue into 2020 at much higher rates than seen elsewhere in the province. Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) Beyond these major prefectures, we can also isolate the nighttime lighting signatures of those detention facilities located in cities administered by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC). The XPCC, known simply as the Bingtuan (or corps) in Mandarin, is a state-owned industrial and paramilitary organization first established in 1954 in order to stabilize and develop Xinjiang, partially in light of its restive history. Over the years, the XPCC has built and developed a number of sub-prefectural cities across Xinjiang, which operate autonomously and independently from the broader Xinjiang civil administration. ASPI's underlying data on known Xinjiang detention facilities suggest that the XPCC operates at least 21 separate facilities across 7 sub-prefectural cities, including Aral, Beitun, Shihezi, Shuanghe, Tiemenguan, Tumshuq, and Wujiaqu. Figure Eight below plots the distribution of nighttime lighting growth trajectories over known detention facilities in XPCC-administered cities, compared to those elsewhere in Xinjiang. The differences between these two groups appear stark, suggesting that detention facilities operated by the XPCC have seen much higher rates of growth and expansion, and minimal periods of decline in nighttime lighting over the past several years. Figure Eight. Nighttime Lighting Growth Trajectories of Xinjiang Detention Facilities, by Location in XPCC-Administered City Note: Cities self-administered by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps with detention facilities in our dataset include: Aral, Beitun, Shihezi, Shuanghe, Tiemenguan, Tumshuq, and Wujiaqu. All other results presented are from non-XPCC prefectures or prefecture-level cities in Xinjiang. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  Figure Nine below plots the frequency of detention facilities in XPCC-administered cities experiencing major periods of growth (positive values) or decline (negative values) in nighttime lighting over time. These results are equally stark, suggesting that XPCC-administered detention facilities continued to expand with much greater frequency into 2019, well past the point at which most detention facilities elsewhere in Xinjiang began to show major declines in nighttime lighting.

All other results presented are from non-XPCC prefectures or prefecture-level cities in Xinjiang. The top panel values plots the percentage of all facilities in a given city or prefecture, in a given month, experiencing an uninterrupted period of growth in smoothed nighttime lighting for at least six months. The bottom panel plots the same, except for facilities experiencing uninterrupted periods of declining nighttime lighting. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  Proximity to Residential Areas We can also assess the extent to which nighttime lighting growth has varied between detention facilities in urban and rural areas of Xinjiang. To do this, we use ASPI's original data on the proximity of each detention facility to nearby residential areas. While not a perfect proxy for urban-rural differences, this metric does help to assess whether greater emphasis has been given to shifting Xinjiang's detention apparatus away from major population centers and into more remote locations. Figure Ten below plots the growth profiles of detention facilities based upon their proximity to residential areas, as gathered by ASPI. Of note, ASPI's underlying data includes a large volume of missing data for this measure. However, these trends still prove illustrative, suggesting that detention facilities in closest proximity to residential areas (within one kilometer) have experienced significantly greater declines in nighttime lighting compared to other facilities. Figure Ten. Nighttime Lighting Growth Trajectories of Xinjiang Detention Facilities, by Proximity to Residential Areas Note: The proximity of individual facilities to residential areas is captured in ASPI's original dataset, but is missing data for 108 separate facilities. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  To assess the timing of these effects, Figure Eleven below plots the frequency of detention facilities experiencing major periods of growth (positive values) or decline (negative values) in nighttime lighting over time, by proximity to nearby residential areas. Few new insights emerge from this figure, except to affirm that those facilities further away from residential areas experienced more frequent growth than others, particularly from 2016 to 2018.

The bottom panel plots the same, except for facilities experiencing uninterrupted periods of declining nighttime lighting. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  Proximity to Other Detention Facilities Across Xinjiang's broader detention system, it is common to see detention facilities collocated with other detention facilities that often serve a different purpose (i.e. of a different type). For context, the average detention facility in our dataset is located only 6.4 kilometers away from the next closest facility on average. But roughly half of all detention facilities are located less than one kilometer from the next closest facility, often within the same compound.\u00a0 Figure Twelve below shows overhead imagery of an example multi-facility detention complex in Ili Prefecture, with a low-security reeducation center (shaded blue) sharing a larger compound with an administrative detention center (shaded green). Other buildings on the compound serve unknown purposes, but overall, these two separate facilities share a common exterior wall, front gate, and road access to the north. Any potential economies of scale from collocating such facilities could incentivize greater physical consolidation of facilities across Xinjiang's detention system going forward. Figure Twelve. Example Multi-Facility Detention Complex in Ili Prefecture, Xinjiang Note: These facilities are located in Ili Prefecture at 44.41, 85.07. The background image was captured on August 19, 2020. The remaining buildings within the compound serve an unknown purpose, not identified as detention facilities in ASPI's original dataset. Source: Imagery from copyright Digital Globe, 2020. Location data from Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  To assess whether physical proximity correlates with the overall growth trajectory of specific facilities, Figure Thirteen below plots the distribution of growth profiles by distance to the next closest detention facility. Overall, these results suggest only minor differences in growth trajectory, with closely proximal (or collocated) facilities demonstrating marginally higher frequencies of uninterrupted growth relative to facilities located further apart. Surprisingly, those facilities located more than 10 kilometers from the next closest facility show similarly high levels of uninterrupted growth. Figure Thirteen. Nighttime Lighting Growth Trajectories of Xinjiang Detention Facilities, by Proximity to Other Detention Facilities Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  To better gauge, the timing of these effects, Figure Fourteen below plots the frequency of detention facilities experiencing major periods of growth (positive values) or decline (negative values) in nighttime lighting over time, based upon their proximity to other detention facilities. Again, we see that facilities both in close proximity to others, and those located more than 10 kilometers away from the next closest facility, experience similar growth patterns over time. Nevertheless, collocated facilities appear to have experienced a decline in nighttime lighting more frequently in recent years. Figure Fourteen.

The bottom panel plots the same, except for facilities experiencing uninterrupted periods of declining nighttime lighting. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  Evidence of Desecuritization In its original analysis, ASPI also assessed whether detention facilities showed signs of desecuritization including through the removal of watchtowers, interior fencing, or exterior walls meant to provide heightened security for certain detention facilities. Reduced levels of security over time could suggest that a detention facility has been downgraded to become a different type of facility within Xinjiang's detention system, such as transitioning from a high-security reeducation center to become a low-security reeducation center. Alternatively, downgraded security could imply that such facilities have actually closed, or been converted into buildings that serve an alternative civilian purpose. Across the 380 facilities in its dataset, ASPI occasionally lacked sufficient imagery to assess evidence of desecuritization. As such, roughly one-third of the facilities in our analysis have missing data for this variable. However, the nighttime lighting growth trajectories of the remaining facilities still prove illustrative for our purposes. In Figure Fifteen below, we compare these growth profiles across those facilities with visible evidence of desecuritization, and those without such evidence. The results show a striking difference between these two types of facilities, where desecuritized facilities experienced far higher rates of partial and major declines in nighttime lighting over time. Figure Fifteen.

Figure Sixteen below then plots the frequency of detention facilities experiencing major periods of growth (positive values) or decline (negative values) in nighttime lighting over time, based upon whether or not a detention facility showed visible signs of desecuritization in ASPI's data. The results suggest that nighttime lighting over desecuritized detention facilities began to rapidly decline relative to other detention facilities, particularly in 2019 and 2020. Overall, these findings suggest that desecuritization may serve as a leading indicator of reduced activity and possible closure of known detention facilities. Figure Sixteen. Xinjiang Detention Facilities Experiencing Major Growth or Decline in Nighttime Lighting, by Evidence of Desecuritization Note: The top panel plots the percentage of all facilities with or without evidence of desecuritization, in a given month, experiencing an uninterrupted period of growth in smoothed nighttime lighting for at least six months. The bottom panel plots the same, except for facilities experiencing uninterrupted periods of declining nighttime lighting. Source: Authors' calculations based upon NOAA VIIRS, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 2020.  Other Factors We also assessed whether nighttime lighting of detention facilities varied based upon the presence of factories inside or adjacent to detention facilities in Xinjiang. As ASPI laid bare in March 2020, a significant aspect of China's detention apparatus in Xinjiang is to use detainees as forced labor at factories, often located on the premises of detention facilities. In its original dataset, ASPI noted whether satellite imagery showed signs of a factory operating inside or adjacent to each detention facility. Surprisingly, we found only insignificant differences in the nighttime lighting signature of detention facilities based upon the presence of these factories. This is\u00a0all the more surprising given that industrial facilities may themselves produce greater nighttime lighting signatures than residential infrastructure. But is possible such factories do not operate at night, rendering nighttime lighting less useful in this case. Similarly, we find only marginal differences in nighttime lighting across detention facilities based upon the presence of internal fencing, exterior walls, or watchtowers, as cataloged by ASPI in its original data. More generally, the presence of these security features is heavily correlated with the overall facility type as analyzed earlier in this report, a more useful metric. Key Takeaways Overall then, this report sought to assess whether certain factors could help explain the growth and decline of detention facilities across Xinjiang. Key takeaways from this analysis include the following, broken down by each relevant factor: Type of Facility: Across Xinjiang, high-security facilities focused on imprisonment and detention of Uyghur and ethnic minority groups have expanded more frequently than lower security reeducation centers. This trend has only accelerated in recent years since 2019, particularly amongst long-term prison facilities rather than administrative detention centers. Region: Detention facilities in southern Xinjiang appear to have grown faster and more frequently in the early years (2016-2017), compared to facilities in northern Xinjiang. Prefecture: Most detention facilities in Xinjiang are concentrated in a set of six key prefectures across Xinjiang (Kashgar, Hotan, Aksu, Ili, Bayingolun, and Urumqi). Of these prefectures, detention facilities in northwestern Ili prefecture (along the Kazakh border) have experienced far greater rates of decline in nighttime lighting over time. Additionally, Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, has shown surprisingly stable levels of activity over time with little evidence of decline in nighttime lighting at its detention facilities. Role of the XPCC: Detention facilities in cities administered by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps experienced much more robust growth in nighttime lighting over time than facilities elsewhere in Xinjiang, particularly since 2019. Proximity to Other Infrastructure: Nighttime lighting data suggest higher rates of growth at facilities further from residential areas, and at those facilities in close proximity to others. However, more recent emphasis has been placed on expanding detention facilities in more isolated locations. Camp Characteristics: Visible evidence of reductions in security at a detention facility over time is closely correlated with major declines in nighttime lighting. However, the presence of factories, or initial usage of internal fencing, external walls, and watchtowers at a facility each show little correlation with the nighttime lighting trajectory of detention facilities writ large.

Looking Ahead This report, the final in a series of three, used nighttime light data to explore trends in the growth and decline of detention facilities across Xinjiang to help better assess the future trajectory of China\u2019s widespread detention of Uyghur and ethnic minority populations in the region. Future research could investigate the trends uncovered in this research using other sources of data, including the potential that higher-security detention facilities have become a greater priority than reeducation centers. Similarly, this research could be updated in the future using nighttime lighting data from future months to assess how these trends have changed over time.  Things To Watch Are these trends correlated with official policy decisions endorsed by Chinese leadership? Can other data sources be used to validate these trends? Will these trends continue into future years?
